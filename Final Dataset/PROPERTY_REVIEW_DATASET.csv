Updated review",Barry W.,Horrible experience...Do not believe anything they say. You've been warned!,1,0
10/18/2011,Lynn H.,"If you enjoy stepping in dog pooh on a daily basis (inside the building), listening to the drunk property manager spat out racial slurs and gossip about your PERSONAL business to everyone in the building, having an owner who's husband is a TWICE convicted FELON with access to your apartment,  broken entry door for unsafe living...then this is the place for you!",1,0
9/18/2019,Augustine ..,"My first Apartment and definitely not planning on leaving soon, this place is well kept, friendly neighbors, and can't forget about the building manager, Leticia Lopez!! She is hands down amazing! She made this whole ordeal easy, and worth it, and even after a year being here she is still willing to help and go the extra mile to make sure living here is comfortable!",5,0
1/13/2017,Natasha M.,"I lived at the Ancelle for the past year and a half.  As a professor I was looking for an artistic and professional building. The apartment building manager Leticia Lopez is amazing. She always attends to fixing things promptly and goes out of her way to ensure a positive, safe and professional culture.

During my time there she was truly a highlight of my experience. Her attention to detail and redesign of the formerly drab lobby made the entrance warm and inviting every night upon coming home. Her standard of excellence is superior to many apartment managers I have interacted with from NYC to the west coast.

Sincerely,

Natasha",5,0
3/15/2019,Vesna L.,"Absolutely horrible experience. Do not listen to the ones who said it is amazing place to live. The safety system is a nightmare, and there were random people knocking on our doors at night. You can't find any security cameras anywhere. The packages are missing all the time, and I have given up on receiving any packages here. The property management team don't know what they are doing , and says they have ""new poilcy"" whenever they want. Really hard to get maintenance. The parking is a total mess. On good thing about it is that you are a party animal, and too bad if you want to sleep at night--expect parties at 2 am every weekend.",1,0
2/24/2019,Xx M.,中国国内朋友介绍说union公寓在韩国城有一个不错的公寓，很多住着的都是在USC读书的同学。当时还在国内的时候guoguo就帮了我很多的忙，还给我解决了到了美国接机的问题，到现在住在悠年韩国城公寓已经有3个月了，住的很舒适，而且住着的人也有很多来自USC的学长学姐。强烈推荐刚来美国的同学，少了很多麻烦，也能少吃很多亏！,5,0
10/23/2021,Sun Non D.,"so disgusting , guest parking cost is 2$ per hour now, what a robbery, making trouble between visitor and the resident, and 3033 wilshire management taking this fee to have fun, awful service, 2$ a hour? what a joke. no one will park and no visitor will come, you guys just block the friends of 3033 wilshire resident. stupid decision
service is geting worse, dont wanna live here anymore, disgusting!",1,0
7/5/2020,Keosily N.,"Poor management.  
I had to break the lease and move out of this hellish place as soon as I could, for the sake of my young daughter.
The list is long: We could smell neighbors smoking cigarettes and marijuana inside building (although landlord the right to prohibit  tenants from smoking in a rental property) Another neighbor was having a loud party, until 3am. Police had to come to stop them. Rude people at common spaces threatening my daughter.
All these I reported to the apartment management but they didn't take any considerable action, so  I pleaded to break the lease so my family could move to a safe place.   They showed no mercy.  
They had another tenant who moved in after me without lapse, but they still collected the penalty and took a huge chunk of my security deposit during COVID-19.  Greedy!
Lame management and unsafe places to live, especially for families.",1,0
7/21/2021,Jezreel T.,Loved that they showed up with mask and shoe coverings. Fixed the problem in under 5 minutes as well as fixed another issue in the apartment in no time. Excellent service.,5,0
2/1/2021,Paul B.,Love this building. Caroline & Olga in the office are great and made the leasing process simple and stress-free. Manny & Florentin are super nice and quickly addressed all the minor issues I had after the inspection. All the folks at the front desk have been very helpful with packages and deliveries. Very happy to be here. Would recommend this place to anyone.,5,0
8/30/2019,Anthony S.,"One more happy customer here.
This building have a great air conditioned gym space, various patios with wonderful furniture, to host outside parties , the pool (on roof with AWESOME VIEW), a jacuzzi, outside barbecues/grills, balconies on every apartment, underground parking, laundry, and probably quite a few other things I'm forgetting to mention. Great and luxurious.
The staff is friendly, helpful and clear.

I am recommend for my friends this apartments.",5,0
8/9/2019,Chris M.,"It was nice having a self guided tour of the building. We got to check out everything ourselves and see what we liked without having anyone else's opinions.

Then we had a meeting with Michael Zubia and he was very helpful. He answered all our questions and helped us with some advice since we are new to LA :)",5,0
8/6/2018,Joan K.,"We love living here.  It is very pleasant.  We had family BBQs on the rooftop with great LA views, swimming, and even used the conference  room for small gatherings.  My husband and I play screen golf on the first floor which is very convenient and we have improved our skill a lot.  Staff are friendly and they serve great coffee in the morning.",5,0

4/17/2017,Alisher A.,This is absolutely beautiful building with all amenities that you need. The rooftop is one of a kind that you can find in Los Angeles. Staff is very nice and are always helping you with any questions. I also want to say big thanks to Timothy who was helping me with the whole process of moving in to this building. Thank you!,5,0
12/25/2016,Paul P.,"Damm good apartment.

Clean, smells good, amenities is very good.

There is smart thermo control, cell phone openable gate.

Coffee is amazing also.
Pool is little shallow but it is ok.

Very nice view at roof top.

Price is higher than others, such as the Vermont.

However, i'm sure that it is worth it.

Managements are very nice and kind as well.",5,0
6/23/2016,Kaylee T.,"The staff at 3033 Wilshire are amazing.  Since the actual building is under construction, I had to visit the temp leasing office in the building next door.  It is unfortunate that the building is no where near compared to the actual office.  As you step in, it is just completely a different atmosphere.  You feel like a true VIP.  The entire staff stood up and greeted me.  You don't get that anywhere in Koreatown.  Jennifer, Sean, and Christine gave me all the information needed for me to understand their perks.  Best thing that stood out to me is their rooftop pool with a 360 view of the city.  AMAZING!!!!  I'll definitely be leasing from them once I'm out of my lease.  CAN'T WAIT TO LIVE IN LUXURY.",5,0
8/5/2021,Amy T.,"As a potential new move in to the Los Angeles area, you'd think the leasing office would be very welcoming and open to answering questions. This was not the case; the lady who answered my call had a disgusting attitude and was unwilling to offer any insight nor willingness to answer any of my questions. Instead she was basically in a hurry to hang up after I voiced to her that I've been trying to contact this leasing office for over 3 weeks. And when I kept asking my questions to clarify what she meant, all she did was repeat the same thing over like a broken record. Keep in mind, I've reached out through the website message board, email, text and phone calls multiple times. This behavior makes me question if this is how they treat potential new tenants, how do they treat their existing tenants. Save your time, money and efforts; if they not willing to help you before even applying, what makes you think they'd actually help you when you live there.",1,0
5/28/2021,Sundaravadivelan B.,It was a pleasant stay at 3700 Sepulveda in past 6 years. My kids like the play area very much and it has all facility inside the Appartment. My family enjoyed very much. All staffs was very nice and friendly.,5,0
3/3/2021,Michael B.,"3700 Sepulveda is a Great Place to live they have many extras like there gym outside patios and BBQ in case you have a large amount of people Basketball and Tennis Courts.

3/2/2021,Kate Z.,"I really enjoyed the three and half years living here at 3700 Sepulveda. It is one of the most wonderful living experience I had in LA. The front office staff were always professional and helpful. The maintenance staff were always around and would complete my service requests within hours. Everyone staff member here are beyond friendly. The facilities were well maintained and have been upgraded several times while I was staying there. During the pandemic time, hand sanitizers and sanitizing wipes are provided in common areas, which making me feel very safe to use the facilities all the time.

The location of the apartment is super convenient with lots of great restaurants, groceries and pharmacy within walkable distance.  I would say it is the best value apartment you can get in West LA! I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to move to the westwide!",5,0
2/16/2021,Garrett C.,"The two and a half years I spent at 3700 Sepulveda was the best apartment experience I had while living in LA. While it is a somewhat older building, it has been updated very nicely, and the amenities are great! If I had planned on staying in LA, I probably would have stayed much longer! It was a pretty quiet community, never had any bug issues,  was maintained nicely, and despite the proximity to the 405, road noise was never an issue. If you're looking for a reasonably priced apartment with lots of amenities, 3700 is a great option!",5,0
1/11/2021,Ben A.,"Absolutely LOVED living at 3700. My wife and I lived there 3 years and we couldn't have been happier. The staff is courteous and helpful. Maintenance is the best crew I have ever experienced. The amenities are top-notch and brand new. The apartments are recently updated and have HUGE bedrooms. No bugs, no smoke issues, no mold. Could not recommend this place more if I tried.",5,0
1/4/2021,Sam D.,"I have lived in this building for the past 7 years and recently moved out. This is the longest I have stayed in any one building and in those 7 years the Management and Staff have always been great.  Goker, Humberto, Manny and Salvador have always been there and made my stay at the building feel like a Resort. I got the level of service I expected, if a problem arose it was fixed within a day or two. Also, the staff and management whom live there know you by name and wave a friendly Hi when passing you by which is a nice but rare commodity in LA. Overall, my time at the The Woodmere which is what it was called back then then before the name change to 3700 Sepulveda, was a very pleasant one.  No tenant horror stories from me, just a person sad to have to go but such is life. Overall, I am grateful for my time there, they made being a tenant too easy.. Everything always works or it gets fixed right away.",5,0
12/23/2020,Daliah E.,"I lived there for 5 years and recently left for grad school. I enjoyed my time there greatly. The apartment complex is very well-mainted and maintenance needs are taken care of very fast.

The manager Goker and the staff have always been really friendly and caring. They are here to help 24/7 and I believe this was the biggest pro living at 3700 Sepulveda.

Gym and pool are always clean and well-maintained. Apartment building is extremely close to grocery stores like CVS, Trader Joe's, Ralphs etc. Moreover, the apartment building is in great location by being close to hot spots like Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney, Culver City, Westwood, Santa Monica and so on. I also find its location very practical for students at SMC and UCLA as a former student. Oh, also the airport! I think it is the great to be able to arrive LAX fast considering the LA traffic. The building also has closed parking lot that I treasure the most, and security is always around 24/7.

I recommend living at 3700 Sepulveda if you're looking for a family-friendly and peaceful place. This place helped me feel at home when I first came to LA, and I am sad for leaving. Hopefully, will be back soon!",5,0
12/10/2020,Kevin P.,Just a great experience.  Close enough to the ocean but everything you want right at home.  Pickle ball to a fitness center.  Outdoor grilling to the hot tub and pool.,5,0
8/21/2020,Kristy S.,"This is the first building I have lived at that continues to make improvements. I've been here almost 6 years and the transformation is pretty incredible. They are in the process of updating apartment interiors which is a tedious task which can cause noise during the day, but all the property upgrades are worth it.

Amazing pool, great BBQ/pool area, outdoor rec area, awesome gym and business center. Of course covid has changed all of our lives and working from home with daytime construction noise is tough, but life goes on and at the end of the day this is a great place to live.",5,0
10/12/2016,George I.,"I had to move out due work relocation. I really enjoyed living in a very  clean place. The management team was very professional,effective and quick on work orders. Location of the building is unbeatable. My balcony got little dusty from the traffic outside but it was well worth of living there. I highly recommend anyone looking for a great place to live. Good luck on your apartment search.",5,0
7/7/2021,Kristen T.,"Moved into these apartments June 1st everything has been amazing so far, the moving in process was very quick and simple and the staff are all very hip and nice. So far every resident are super welcoming and everyone says hello to each other. The 24/7 gym and dog run have been very useful as well as the Amazon grocery store. Apartment is extremely safe and secure and practically brand new! Also love the roof top view of the 360 city view. Stan and Danny rock!",5,0

8/20/2020,Joseph G.,My gf and I went all around WeHo and NoHo looking at places for later this year. We found  L and o after looking at the high rise building Noho14. We could have gotten a 10th floor apartment there for around $3400 but we didn't like the vibe of the people there. We don't want to compromise on service attitude anymore. We drove all the way from Covina and Denny helped us right away and even though it was already 5pm he took us for the tour. We were shocked at how sincere he was. We Forgot our masks and he had extra brand new ones to give us. Bonus: he gave us KitKat bars chips and sparkling water Lol! Denny took the time to show us a bunch of units and didn't mind my gf changing her mind a lot. He even had a tape measure handy. We're extremely into fitness and the biggest thing we can't wait for is their huge gym. It will be open 24hrs and even has Olympic bumper plates and deadlift rack. Insane. Looking forward to moving here this winter.,5,0
8/14/2020,Christian M.,"I haven't logged in a minute but felt the need to because the staff here doesnt deserve the negative review that has nothing to do with them (we love you Stan the man!). we're between moves staying with family and will be moving here in September and have been watching this place get built over the last year. Theres a Whole Foods opening downstairs and that was the main draw in for us besides hating our current management situation. Look all the buildings around here are essentially the same but for us after staying at noho lofts and going through management changes, were done compromising on bad attitudes and walking on eggshells. From the time we called until signing paperwork stan and the team members there have been insanely helpful and nice. Stan felt like an instant friend or even family. Their pool on the roof and huge gym center is super sick too. Were excited nd hope its not just smoke and mirrors with the customer service but from what we can tell, it feels like boutique customer service already and their concierge guy in a nice suit even personally walked us to the office because we were confused. September 21st moving day cant come soon enough.",5,0
11/17/2017,Sherri L.,"The Villa Del Mar in LA staff was very professional, check in and check out was very fast and easy, apartments clean, quiet and nice. The place was cozy. Very nice &modern. We are recommending this place strongly :)",4,0
8/10/2013,Chris L.,So Happy I moved here the customer service was great and the place is kept up very nice i thought this was only going to be a year long move but i think i just might stay longer. If you looking to move down this way this is where you might want to check out,5,0
11/19/2020,James W.,"Definitely NOT what they are advertising on the website and their ads. I guess during the pandemic standards are being ignored just to make their bottomline. Smoke and Marijuana is everywhere. Apartments are not built well, constant creaking and cracking. You can hear your neighbors upstairs, outside and next door. Plus it is right next to fire station so be prepared to hear sirens all throughout the night and day.",1,0
5/24/2020,Justin R.,"Mack Property group is a disgrace to all business best practices. This group embodies the worst parts of capitalism.

We sent a request to Aven asking for rent compensation since our amenities have not been open for over two months. We received this response, which echoes the ethos of this company. I finally feel compelled to speak up.

As a business owner and customer, the letter attached is not just a little inappropriate but HIGHLY inappropriate to reference the financial balance sheet of Mack Property as an excuse to why they have poor customer experience and expect the residents of AVEN to subsidize their financial losses.

I do not care that Mack Property group is experiencing increased operating expenses and a loss of of revenue in the face of COVID-19. Mack Property group, like every other business, needs to access debt/equity markets to shore up their debt, ensure a quality product, and/or reimburse residents for their losses.

It is not my job as a consumer to absorb the risk of the capitalists (Mack Property mackredev.com and AECOM Capital aecom.com/aecom-capital) who took the risk to make an investment in Aven and other residential communities. I am not seeing any upside appreciation of my money (as many of us are currently experiencing) so I do not think that I, or anyone at AVEN, should be subsidizing the loses of this business or any business for that manner.

If Mack Property group wants to act as strong leaders they will be forthcoming in how they are going to alleviate these problems their consumers are experiencing. And pay us back.

I honestly would show more sympathy for this company if they were forthcoming, but they are not and business owners/investors like this need to be washed out so that we can have better owners/investors with better values, leadership, and financial discipline. If they can't make this right, then they should file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and take responsibility.

It is companies like this, that have driven a whole generation to hate businesses and free-enterprise. It is disgusting to watch and give my money to this organization.",1,0
10/29/2019,Bree N.,"Stars shouldn't be the only thing an incompetent apartment building can receive. How about the ""middle finger?"" I don't write reviews...period EVER because I find them to be a total waste of time. However, I had to announce the scum bag employee Merci Lim. She claims to be a Leasing Director I guess to appear relevant but when you call the owners in Boston, they say she's just a leasing consultant. Either way tomatoe/tomato...Merci called my cell with mis-information regarding an approval for me to move in. The conversation began with me requesting that my information be re-evaluated because the way the apartments approve and deny applicants is totally computer generated. Meaning it can be overridden by an actual human-being! Irregardless of property standards, their standards are too high for the poor quality of employees. Whether they say they can't or not, everything in life can be negotiated! Ask ANY entrepreneur or great business owner. I was approved with an additional deposit. Everyone who lives in the state of California knows it is very difficult to find a suitable place to lay your head. With crime at it's most high and the amount of money required to be safe is utterly ridiculous. Aven requires your first born child and a kidney just to rent a studio. I don't care how nice a building looks inside or outside nor do I give a rats ass about it's amenities, if I'm not going to own it later or if it doesn't pay me equity then its temporary BS. Now back to the original reason for this truthful post, Merci Lim is a demon from the pit of hell. No one should sign a 2,4,6,8,12,nor 24 month lease term on anything there with an individual like her on property. If it's hard to get approved it could be a sign that you're going to have a thorn in your ass, so I went with my gut and pulled my deposit. Not to mention all of the employees who live on-site as well just to get discounted rent. The units that they occupy could be rented to external residents that can pay more! So there you have it...more income out the door! Merci, flat out told me that ""I would be denied"" before she even collected all of the paperwork requested in order to move forward. She blatantly violated the ""Fair Housing Laws."" What kind of jack ass would do such a thing? Her job is to make sure that the apartment building is 100% leased! I was clearly a qualified candidate already with just a matter of bringing in paycheck stubs! Not deny future residents over the phone with your opinions without clear facts or documentation in front of you to make clear judgment! Merci needs to find another job. She's obviously NOT qualified to handle any situation in a professional and effective manner. If a tenant came in and reported this type of behavior to me, it would be grounds for termination of employment! I would not put up with that sh*t! Every person who has a title (i.e. director, manager, supervisor) don't always mean they're qualified or intelligent enough to handle the job given. I look at it like this, I always tell my money what to do, so if I am not treated with the respect that I am due, then you and your company can kiss my ass! No business from me, my friends, family, colleagues, acquaintances, etc. It only takes a minute to report bad businesses. I'm sure H.U.D. and the California Dept of Fair Housing would love to see another case on their desk in the morning. In addition to the BBB and any other web-based method to report a complete idiot. According to her LinkedIn profile she only stays in a leasing role for 1 year at most. Which speaks loudly to me as a Manager, she's a job hopper and she keeps a very un-attractive tenure with a lot of her previous companies. This clearly shows me as I thought from the very beginning...she's obviously NOT WORTH KEEPING! I will continue pursue further action against Merci Lim until the proper action is taken!

Thank you for reading and stay tuned...

P.S.) Instead of one star, I give this hell hole a two ""THUMBS DOWN!"" There are PLENTY of Tall buildings in DTLA, that makes this crap look like a one-story! Keep looking and don't waste your time.

Aven Employees: Please don't act like you care and respond with a ruthless apology because it won't be accepted! Have Paul Chambers call me when he's ready to discuss how he can find a new ""so-called"" Leasing Director!",1,0
2/23/2019,Corey W.,Will follow up soon with more info.,1,0
7/2/2020,Yu Yan C.,"So first we're promised credits for shutting down the amenities and now are given none as the management ""NEVER ANTICIPATED the length of these closures to span nearly three months""??? I am sooooo confused considering the amenities started to reopen on May 28 which aligns with when Aven DID ANTICIPATE reopening:

""Information regarding account credits for the reduction of amenity use will be assessed once these spaces are safe to re-open. At this time, we anticipate that being around mid-May.""

Given that some of the residents have lost their jobs, a small reimbursement is the least AVEN could do to support its community. Not to mention, the amenities is why the housing costs in this building are so high in the first place. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! Oh well...By saving on credits MACK properties will probably spend even more on getting people back.

If you still consider to invest in Aven, please know:

- Amenities are shared with a building next door (Grand Loft) which was never mentioned when signing the lease
- Cheep squeaky floors inside the units
- Dryer is a complete disaster, have to run 3 times for a single load
- Utility bills - water costs are split between all residents and the electricity meter has been broken for the past couple of months so when you're out of town, don't be surprised if the bill is still high",2,0
9/5/2019,Social M.,"The building has so many amenities and is trying to offer all these perks but cant even manage to get additional Fobs/Keys for Residents. If you have maids or Dog sitters coming regularly you have to leave your own fob at the front desk and pick it back up. Which without a fob you cant even get into the building so you have to wait until somebody at concierge is at the front and wait until they are free to give you a key AND find parking in front of the building just to pick up your own house key and you cant even park your car in the Garage since you cant get into the Building trough the garage without keys.  Is it that hard to have a copy of your keys at concierge and an acknowledgement from the tenant to have set times when a spare key is needed like any other building?
Instead of being rude about the situation and having a normal conversation trying to figure out a way they just say "" this is how it is"" and "" add the dog walker to your lease"" . You guys can do better!",2,0
8/11/2020,South Park R.,"As someone who lived here for 16+ months, I thought I would provide an honest mention of issues that many reviews haven't touched on, especially the early 5-star reviews because keep in mind--AVEN will give back the cost of your application when you leave a review before signing, which is a bit unfair because of course people will say yes to that yet their review would only be based on the ""wow"" factor of seeing all the amenities and not on the actual living experience.

1. FIRE ALARM TESTING. We just got another email that prompted me to write this review. AVEN is a new building with vacant ground floor tenant spaces so what does that mean? Construction, fire inspections + ALARM TESTS. If you don't think it'll be that bad I've attached a pic of some emails we've received about testing, and that's not all of them. Though now we're in COVID times and lots are WFH, I can't imagine having gone to work this past year knowing my dog is home alone during all-day fire alarm testing. Not to mention staying at home with an infant or young child. Keep in mind that AVEN doesn't have control over how often the fire inspections/alarm tests will take place--that's up to how well the tenant does at clearing & passing all the fire code requirements, and that's not easy to do with a brand new restaurant space. AVEN themselves will admit that they can't really control it and can only hope the tenant does their best on the inspections. I imagine that more alarm testing will be going on in the next 4-6+ months, as they've just started construction.

2. GRILL AREAS SMELL LIKE DOG PEE IN THE HEAT. I have to start by saying that compared to other buildings in South Park , AVEN does the ABSOLUTE BEST JOB at washing away dog pee every day. Some buildings on Grand & Hill will make you want to barf just walking by, but AVEN's not like that at all. They hose down both the front entrance sidewalk & dog park every day. HOWEVER, whoever designed the amenity deck put the grills & tables literally right next to the ""dog park"" and dog walkway, which you can see on pictures shared. During the winters I didn't notice this as much but during the summer (which is grilling season!) it's bad. It smells like dog pee while you're grilling & eating. Any heat makes the smell especially unbearable and toward the end of the day is the worst, after a full day of 36 floors of dogs having peed in that area. I've seen residents cursing as they got up from the tables & left from the smell of dog pee.

3. UTILITY BILLS. AVEN has acknowledged and has written to us about our utility bills. Basically, utility bills are based on # of occupants & square footage than on meter reads. If you don't travel much, this might not be a problem but I've seen posts on our community board where residents will go out of town for 2-3 weeks out of a month and their utility bill comes out the same, and this is due to the way utility bills are calculated. I can also attest to this because we used to not run our dishwasher as much to save on water+electricity, but after finding out about this, we went from running it 1-2 times/month to 3-4 times/week and didn't see any increases in our bill. So if you're someone who travels often & doesn't want to pay for utilities you're not using, this is something to consider.

4. FLOOR BOARDS. The pictures of weird floor board placement in other reviews are true--we have 2 floor ""gaps"" in our own apartment. For us they're in our bedroom so guests can't see them, but they're really just a small annoyance where dust and other particles get stuck. More bothersome than the gaps are the floor boards themselves. I'm not sure how to describe them other than they feel like wood without a final coat on them. The floors are not easy to clean and get dirty extremely easily (something to consider if you have kids...or if you just spend a lot of time at home lol). I feel like they might just be of lesser quality in general because I would say after a few months of living here there are areas that ""creak"" when we walk on them now.

5. AMENITIES. If you're planning on moving during COVID, just keep in mind that most of the ""perks"" mentioned in other reviews don't currently apply. Resident events probably won't happen again for another 4-5 months or more, the gym is closed, you can't have family or guests in the amenities, and you have to wear masks when you're at the pool and basketball courts. Yes, there is a security member who will literally patrol the amenity deck every day & ask you to wear one even if you're standing by/sitting in the pool & not full-on ""swimming"" or are playing basketball. I get these are safety measures but just something to keep in mind.

AVEN is definitely a luxurious place to live, but these are a few points to consider before making an ultimate decision.",4,0
4/15/2021,Neomal M.,"My wife and I are new to Aven apartments and we a extremely pleased with their services.
Moving into LA from the East Coast was not easy but we were fortunate to meet Penny Martel (Leasing consultant) who made our transition an ease. She got all the paper work lined up in a timely manner and we were able to relocate to LA as planned without much difficulty.
Penny was always very courteous and professional. Highly recommended.",5,0
3/7/2021,Lizzy A.,Mahea Leofa was my leasing consultant and she absolutely improved the apartment search for me. She was so welcoming and was very informative.

3/29/2019,Roxanne R.,"Very excited to find out today that my application to AVEN has been approved. AVEN's Leasing office has been super helpful in my transition from San Francisco to Los Angeles. For the location and in comparison to other properties in the area, AVEN's deals are unmatched.

I'm looking forward to moving into the thoughtfully designed, spacious space with plenty of natural light. Additionally, with the electronic entry system I do not have to worry about my safety compared to other rental units downtown.

I'm excited for the new experience and am super appreciative to Arron and Merci for all their help with this transition.",5,0

5/6/2021,Ket L.,"SAFETY WARNING! I've been here for 1 month and the elevator already broke TWICE. The very last time, a lady was stuck in the elevator for over an hour!!!! Can you believe it? I am so scared of taking the elevator now and I feel unsafe because you never know when you'll be the next person getting stuck in the elevator.
Other than that, the walls are so thin that when someone else closes their door next door, you can feel the entire floor vibrating. Like they really took some shortcuts in building this apartment.
It is great location though...",1,0

5/13/2019,Jazmine W.,"I moved to Luna on August 1, 2018. The building is nice and new. The young security guy is very nice and observant. He's aware of who lives at the place and who doesn't. There is a team of security men, but they are not all nice! I have two dogs, so one downside is that there isn't any green space on the property for you to walk your pet or for your pet to play. The only other downside is that there isn't a pool. For the price of the place and especially it being new construction, I would think that they'd have a pool. I haven't had any issues since living here, and I feel that Shayne is very responsive and helpful. If you decide to move here, take advantage of the roof top deck (lovely views, BBQ pits, fire pits, TV's). I also love that there is a gym facility on site that it always very clean! I also notice the cleaning staff cleaning very frequently which is a MAJOR plus for me!",4,0
1/16/2020,Cuong P.,"I've lived in K-town for about 9 years now and this is definitely the best place I've lived at so far. I've been at Luna for 18 months and recently extended for another 15 months. It's located at the heart of K-town and walking distance to pretty much anywhere.

The amenities are great! It has a gym, 24-hour security, in unit washer/dryer, centralized air/heating system, and roof top with multiple BBQ and TVs. Unfortunately, no pool.

Beyond the amenities, I have to give it up to management! Shayne is the best! I've never had a better experience with management. He's always been accessible when needed and quick at responding to all of my request. He's proactive at sending email updates to keep us informed about anything going on with the building. What I like best is that he makes sure everyone is accountable to making this a great living experience for not just themselves but for everyone else. Because at the end of the day, we're all paying to live in a clean, nice and safe apartment building.",5,0
12/6/2019,Ivan Y.,"Have been living at Luna for a year now. Management is extremely professional and courteous- better than any larger complex nearby. If you want the convenience of Koreatown but without all the nonsense and noise at a larger property, you will love Luna.

Shayne works really efficiently to fix any issues, which is not much since the building is mostly brand new.",5,0
12/2/2019,Patrick M.,"I've lived here at Luna for 13 months and I can say that it's a nice place to live. Shayne is great, and he always assisted my apartments needs promptly.

10/3/2019,Corey D.,"I've lived in this apartment for a little over a year and here are my thoughts.

Pros:
-Great deals upon signing the lease such as internet discounts, free parking etc.
-Shane and the rest of the management we're always available and prompt to help and answer questions. Overall, they make sure things get done. Shane made my stay at Luna enjoyable for sure. 10/10.

Cons:
Didn't have any during the duration of my lease. Would highly recommend",5,0
10/3/2019,Aari G.,"My roommate and I lived here for a little over a year, and we really liked it. Luna Apartments is in a very great location in downtown Koreatown; there is amazing food and plazas all around, it's walking distance from a bunch of coffee shops, and it's very close The Wiltern. There's a gym, a community laundry area, and nice rooftop patio with seating areas where people can barbecue and relax. There's also an easily accessible online portal where rent can be paid and maintenance requests can be forwarded; since it was both of our first times living away from home, this made things less stressful for us. The Luna Management team, and the manager Shayne, are very promptly responsive to any questions or concerns. We had a few minor maintenance issues, like a clogged shower drain, and my requests were often fulfilled within 24 hours. I had unfortunately broken the folding pantry door, and though the process of replacing the door requires a lot of specific maneuvering and contracting, we were met with patience. It was difficult for us to maneuver was the dryer on the washer/dryer combination, but it is still convenient and time saving to have access to that in the apartment. Overall, we have noticed a lot of improvement in the building, and  management communication, since the early months of our lease. We've noticed, what seems to be, continuous efforts to adapt and ensure tenant comfort; and it has made us appreciate our experience living in Luna Apartments!",5,0
7/1/2019,Danny D.,"I have lived here since December with my partner and honestly we loved it. The building is very clean and the facilities such as the rooftop and the gym are wonderful. The people that live in the building are very polite and the area is a hidden gem of LA.

The management are very attentive. If there is ever a problem maintenance is on it. A particular shout out to Shayne, it cannot be easy running an apartment building of this size.

It is one of the happiest places I have lived in Los Angeles and I love coming home to my apartment.

If there are any bad reviews, honestly, it's those really picky people that complain about anything.

Thank you Luna. I loved calling you home!",5,0
6/17/2019,Nate C.,"Great place to live if you are looking for an apartment in ktown area. Both the apartments and the garages are gated so i feel pretty safe even though living in ktown can be otherwise. They have a really nice rooftop where they have three grills, each for three separated areas, which is very nice. I've been living here since soon after they opened, and I haven't had a problem with my neighbors or the staff. Shayne, the management at this place is really nice and easy to talk to.",5,0
6/17/2019,Francisco P.,"This was the first apartment I moved in to LA and the first tenant in my unit, it's been pretty great. The unit itself is pretty nice, there is security outside of office/management hours, keycard/badge entry, and a private 2 story garage.

I've had to deal with some loud neighbors, however management, in particular Shayne, has been great at dealing with those issues and actually taking some initiative to try to resolve it.  This has been a big plus for me which has earned it the 5 stars for me.

There are a lot of places to eat around here as well as several coffee shops. I feel safe walking around here, even at night. There is always someone walking out and about.

One thing to note is that the main entrance is actually on Harvard, not wilshire.",5,0
9/9/2018,Austin L.,This building is located close to a ton of great restaurants and metro stations. The front office and anyone else I've encountered at this building is very kind and helpful. The building has great amenities with a cool zen courtyard as well. Jena was very helpful with moving us in.,5,0
6/22/2019,Mike P.,"Rent is high for what you get compared to the area. The promotion prices seem good, but they raise the prices on your when you renew and add additional charges as the years go on. They used to not charge for parking, but they now force you to pay for parking.

There are plenty of options at better value. K2 apartments and Radius next door are both nicer with better value. Wilshire/vermont apartments have direct access to the metro and have nicer apartment at better prices.

The Thompson not far away on Wilshire Blvd is a new building and have a ton of new units with better prices. A new apartment complex is being built across from Park Catalina at better prices.

When the office is closed, packages will be left outside of the office or in front of your door and they WILL get STOLEN. Kids from the school across come in the building to smoke weed and steal packages. They need a package locker like all of the modern apartment complexes these days.

There are plenty of options at a better price around K-Town.",1,0
4/29/2017,Marve K.,"Horribly managed office hours.

Don't move in unless you don't order anything online, no package delivered to your place in time.

They just don't care much.

You will be getting this a lot.
'Delivery attempted
An attempt was made to deliver your package, but the business was closed. Please look for a notice of attempted delivery for the next steps.'

This happens very often.
They just leave a note saying ""we are open 11am to 1pm"" even though regular office hour is 9am to 6pm and shut the door.

This will be very frustrating.
I would not moved in if I knew this so please save yourself.

Also they don't pay that much for maintaining the building.
Garbage chute is being clogged very often, flies everywhere, the entire building smells like a shithole.

Good luck to moving in",1,0

Every time we visit her to ask questions or request maintenance (such as replacing the screen or re-touching the wall), she greets us so kindly and promptly gives us a solution.

10/16/2019,Cameron T.,"My son and best friend recently moved to LA to attend school.  In August, my wife, the boys and I flew out to LA to tour the areas that would be near both schools and in an area they felt reasonably save.  During that tour, we meet the staff at Park Catalina Apartments and were so impressed with their facility, positive attitude, willingness to accommodate our limited schedule that we decided that this was the place for them.  The apartment they showed us had been recently renovated with all new floors, countertops and appliances.  Since we initiated the process, every member of their staff: Jazmin Pegeron, Dave Giguere & Pierre Brougeille, have gone above and beyond what was expected to meet what ended up being a very challenging window to obtain due to classes for one of the boys starting within 30 days of the date we were ready to make a commitment.  Initially, the boys would have arrived with the U-Haul 3 days prior to the move-in date.  Jazmin had a matching newly renovated apartment on the same floor give notice a few days before the boys left for LA, allowing them to move in when they arrived.  Service at this level in the apartment business is rare.  I recommend to anyone looking for an apartment in their area to contact Jazmin, Dave or Pierre to see if they can accommodate you.",5,0

I was searching around at one hundred and one apartments communities and was having a super tough time making a decision until I walked into Vinz! Everyone was helping me, asking if I wanted refreshments, joking around with me and I knew this was the one! The move in process was smooth, quick, and fun and I haven't had one problem since I've started here (which is super rare when it comes to renting because we all know something always comes up). I've had a blast in my first month, have super respectful neighbors, and love showing off my new resort style apartment to all my jealous friends! If you decide to rent anywhere, check out Vinz and I am sure you will not be disappointed! P.s. the guy who actually showed me my apartment was a FOX!!! I think he was a manager there because he had an office but when he stepped out to help me I was like GOOD MORNING TO ME!!! Total hunk and was super nice.

Even the hotel with a rooftop bar down the block is prohibited from making this much noise. The staff do nothing and are rude. There is no respect for the people who live in this community, who own property and try to make a home for their tenants.

The building is full of inconsiderate YouTubers and we frequently see escorts coming and going. Their ""community park"" is full of drug addicts and feces.",1,0

10/25/2021,Mike P.,"It's a sinking ship here.

- Everyone worth the fees we pay that used to work here has either left or been let go of- minus 1or 2. One after another. Building's only been open about 3 years. Unbelievable turnover.
- Our main (and only) gate wasn't working for the better part of 2 months. Lots of ""fluff"" about it, but what can you really believe these days? Finally up and running. And ok, we had a ""guard"" brought in that wasn't always there...
-Practically all the main people living here have or are leaving. Sure, maybe some are for betterment, but when you see people you know picking up and moving out, one after the other over several months, it makes you wonder and it starts to add up.
- SMOKE-FREE building- NOT SO MUCH! Elevator- smells like pot. Hallway- (I know not just mine) smells like pot. Unit- smells like pot with door/window shut. Balcony- smells like pot.
- Dog piss - literal cascade of piss- constantly raining down on your balcony if you're lucky enough to have a dog anywhere above you. Feel sorry for those living several levels below me!
- Balconies have no lights and you're not allowed to have lights unless it's building approved, which they won't approve! For half a year we've been told they will purchase lights for us, so far nothing. Put my request in long ago. Probably lost with all the ship jumpers. I swear it's like a dorm here. Can't do anything without a letter being put out about it.
- Communal Spaces- yes. Want to reserve a spot for a small get-together? Yes- but only if you pay an exorbitant usage fee! And if there's buyout for filming or something, you're assed out. Nothing comes to you for the inconvenience of not being able to access what you're supposed to be able to access via the fees you pay for rent. It's Hollywood. Filming doesn't happen for free peeps.
- The hall to the gym is affectionately known to some here now as the Hall of Snortsville. It sounds like there's a cocaine fest happening.. You can't walk to the gym or library without hearing so much snorting coming out of the main office. It's ridiculous!

Can I go on? Yep. I will close by saying do your research before you choose this place. I get it, this is a one of a kind building. That's why I'm still here. I don't know for how much longer as you can tell. Addiction is in many forms.
If none of what I wrote affects you, you have nothing to worry about. But if you value your freedom and don't want to live somewhere that's nothing more than a money making opportunity for the owners, look around. There is better value for your dollar- no matter the dollar you make.",1,0

The leasing office is chalk full of professional and knowledgeable personnel who always greet you with a smile. 24/7 concierge team that goes above and beyond for your needs, even in our COVID driven limitations. It doesn't get any better than Bryan and Geoff! The current maintenance team is incredible and invests the time and resources needed for creative solutions to repetitive issues. I had a balcony door that constantly blew open during high winds, often breaking the hardware that's supposed to keep it from doing just that. Renzo, the building manager, came up with some kind of bar replacement (not Mickey Moused) that eliminated the issue entirely. Thanks Renzo! The cleaning crew (big props to Abraham...my Laker man!) is non-stop, including night crew several nights a week. Always insuring the upkeep and appearance of the building is level 1- especially difficult on weekend nights- but they get it done. It is with heartfelt sadness that I've had to relocate.

The green spaces are beautiful and well maintained, as well as all of the common areas are cleaned every single day at 6am. I am up early every morning and the entire building is immaculate by 8am. The aesthetics are beautiful and you know when you find Jo Malone diffusers in the lobby bathrooms that you are in a special place. Terra is the full time concierge and is amazing and super friendly.

They even leave nice hand-written cards after cleaning the apartment!

The common areas are well kept, and not to mention very well decorated, especially the game room with the fun pool table and TVs. The outdoor pool on the 5th floor has amazing views of Hollywood (facing the iconic Capitol Records building), and is always immaculate.

Ryan is extremely knowledgeable and really pleasant to work with. He could tell me everything to do in the area from the Hollywood Sign hike, to all of the ""go to"" restaurants and hot spots! After shopping around you cannot beat the price and location. Right on the sunset strip a couple blocks from all of the touristy attractions on Hollywood Blvd.

I took a look at a studio and 1 bedroom. The apartments are brand new-nice knowing the appliances are brand new too! These are luxury apartments that come with quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances and even keyless entry into your home (like entering in your code on your cell phone!).

The amenities are not open yet, but expected to in May as long as there are no delays with the construction. There will be a sky deck on the top floor facing the Hollywood sign(awesome for small get together), a clubhouse, pool, spa and 2 story fitness center. There's some type of pet washing station and pet park, but I didn't really pay attention since I don't have a pup.

FIRST - When I enquired on my appt, the price was $2400. 2 days later the price was $2700 and they wouldn't honour the original price I was given. SECOND - When I told them I wanted to break my lease and move out, they told me they could put me on Rent Responsible which means they will advertise my apartment and I can stop paying rent as soon as someone else leases my apartment. THEY DIDN'T ADVERTISE MY APARTMENT UNTIL 2 MONTHS LATER, when I threw a stink about it. And made up a STUPID excuse as to why it wasn't advertised. THIRD - I have since moved out, and it's been 34 days and I still have not received my deposit (because the first time they sent it to me a week ago, they wrongly put some other randoms name on the check so I couldn't deposit it). Most of the people who work here are incompetent so don't get your hopes up.

In in case corporate want to know how ALL the residents (Yes, we have a group chat) feel about your staff, here is quick summary:

Jordan (leasing manager) - He's nice enough, but hasn't really learnt that his job comes with responsibilities yet so don't take his title seriously.
Analicia (ass. manager) - Absolutely the most incompetent person working in the building, she has NO idea wtf she's talking about and has to 'check with the manager' about everything which makes her job pretty redundant.
Courtney (leasing) - Should not be in customer services because she talks to people like she owns the Earth and we are all getting in the way of her date with herself.
Jackie (leasing) - She's a gem. She is the only thing this place has going for it.
David (leasing) - Harmless but hasn't read the user manual for his job - so don't believe anything he says.

Basically, do yourself a favour and stay away from this place.",1,0
8/9/2019,Paire Amour T.,"It's a shame I live in this community, kourtney is rude as helll, the staff is not helpful at all , Poor customer service, i am very dissapointed on the Qouted good services that camden has to offer. POOR RATING -10 IF possible.",1,0
10/10/2018,Maxwell J.,"Really nice communal spaces and amenities, and the units themselves are well done. However, you're buying into management and community, not just nice finishings - both of which are terrible here. The fire alarms go off at least once a week after midnight and management has done nothing about it. The hallways aren't kept the cleanest, the rent is exorbitant for the building to not have a gym (the discount at EQX is nice but not THAT nice), and everyone seems to have a problem getting their deposits back when they leave.

Until they fix the management disconnect, it's not worth it to pay this much to not be able to sleep.",1,0
1/29/2017,Ian H.,"I can't tell you how many times the fire alarms have gone off here since I moved in and I have only lived here for less than 2 months.

I have been woken up between 3am-6am more times than I can count on both hands. I have trouble sleeping and can't get back to sleep after they go off and they go off for minimum 10 minutes. I cant sleep afterwards so by the time I have to leave for my work at 9am I am so tired and my entire day is affected. I hear from other frustrated occupants of the camden that they experience fire alarms nearly everyday during the sunlight hours as well as the early morning however I am normally not home in the daytime to experience this.

Then when you talk to management they do nothing other than say they are working on resolving this. They do not care. They just want your money then once you move in they just do not care.

I am so unhappy living here and am looking to breaking my lease early.

Save yourself the time viewing this place and look elsewhere",1,0
1/28/2017,Sarah M.,"Elevators are out of service more 3 times per week and take at least a day to fix. I live on the 4th floor so every time the elevators are out which is very often I have to walk down then back up 4 flights of stairs. Imagine carrying 4 bags of groceries up 4 or more flights of stairs almost every week, it's horrendous and the staff or manager have not once offered help or offered to make a deduction from rent for the inconveniences. I couldn't imagine if I lived on the 7th floor with the elevators being out of service multiple times per week like they are.",1,0
9/12/2016,Jake P.,"If you're looking for the most Ghetto apartment complex in Hollywood- look no further than The Camden.  We listen to constant altercations between our neighbors, loud music blasting from the sketchy folks hanging in the pool and the constant loud fire alarms going on daily/night monthly.
And now we have RATS IN THE TRASH AND NO WATER AT ALL FOR AN ENTIRE 48 hours so far.
Management is doing absolutely nothing for their residents. Be cautious of the community manager, he is literally unable to make decisions and fails to respond to emails on a regular basis.
You would think in this day and age that a tenant wouldn't have to listen to the elephant living above. The ceilings/floor are paper thin. Shame the construction is so cheap for ""luxury living"".
Leasing agent/sales were caught in too many lies.

Pool is nice but lately is a frat party on the weekends.  
Maintenance is nonexistent or clueless. They are not qualified in any aspect of handyman workmanship.
The Camden is a hostile living environment that I strongly suggest you avoid.",1,0
9/12/2016,Hayel R.,"I would advise people to look elsewhere. The staff is incredibly rude in the office, including the manager. The office hours are ridiculous if you work in an office job. There is no security and or maintenance. There are several issues within the building that are overlooked by incompetent employees.

I feel like I'm living in the ghetto. It doesn't look like the ghetto - but beware - it operates as such.
.
Another neighbor three doors down had a wild party - bongs and all - 3am it was still raging. Guess who had to ask them to quiet it down? NOT SECURITY.

The evacuation/smoke alarms go off ALL the time at insane times - middle of the night/early mornings.

The building has been falling apart and not repaired since no one has a clue of what needs to be done.
Final straw was that there is no hot water or cold water as of Monday September 12 and who knows when the water will return.  No alert was sent to the residents about the situation, email or nothing until later that night. That email only stated that there was something wrong and that more details will follow as they become available.

The incessant barking dogs do not help either.

DO NOT MOVE HERE!",1,0
9/12/2016,E M.,"The Leasing agents are totally unprofessional & inept for problems concerning tenant units on repairs such as pipes, and appliances. The building as of right now doesn't have any water either hot or cold going now for 24 hrs.
The people who work in the office are rude and argumentative. The fire alarm goes off in the middle of the night sometimes 3-4 times in one night. The hallways smell like urine or most of the time POT. The pool is always dirty. Everyone who works in the office tells you a different thing if you have any questions, no one is on the same page. DO NOT make the mistake of moving in here unless you like feeling disrespected and treated like shit, especially for the price you are paying which is much higher than nicer apartments in the same area.
Moved in July in and I'm already regretting it big time. Everything here is falling apart and the management really doesn't seem to care whatsoever. Very rude management. I live here & and literally nothing works from the Air conditioning, the trash compactor, to a simple act of being able to take a shower since they cut the water now for 24 hrs and going just for the fun of it. No one has a single clue how to run this place, hiring again nothing but incompetent, non- qualified people that doesn't have a single clue on what to do.
The staff is more interested in having FREE pool parties so every hobo from W Hollywood can stop by and have free wine tasting and free pool usage.
The management staff are fake smiles and promises.
Also, the elevator has been broken on and off now, and you can't enter the residences from the stairs, so enjoy your morning commute!  
The security is nothing but a ridiculous joke. They SIT DOWN in their PHONE ALL DAY LONG.  They are completely USELESS and utterly ignorant.
I could go on and on about this place but what's the point since they will probably delete this review and replace it with a fake one anyhow.  IF YOU ARE ABLE TO READ THIS, AVOID THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX!!!!!!!!!

I WOULD GIVE THIS PLACE NO STARS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!!!",1,0
7/7/2017,Damien B.,"Overall this is a great complex with all the luxury amenities, including a saltwater pool and spa, screening room, outdoor cooking areas and 24-hour front desk service.  The area is growing rapidly with a Trader Joes conveniently located across the street and a Whole Foods planned for the near future up the block, as well as new eateries and entertainment venues opening all the time.  

There are a couple of things where the property falls short for which I am holding back that 5th star.  First, they built the main lobby with only one elevator.  A single elevator to service 10 floors.  Needless to say, tenants spend sometimes 5 minutes or more waiting on an elevator to arrive.  There are 3 other elevators in opposite corners of the building, but more consideration should have been put into the main lobby, especially when the other elevators seem to go out-of-service regularly.  Second, they did not install sinks in the main outdoor kitchen, so we are preparing food and handling raw meat and there is nowhere nearby to wash our hands or cooking utensils.  Third, and this is just based on my preferred design esthetic, they have a multitude of Camden branded rain mats covering the beautifully designed poured concrete flooring in the lobby.  They are ugly and dingy and should only be put out as a safety measure when it's wet outside, alas I have mentioned this to management and nobody has acknowledged it.   Lastly, there is a lot of new construction going on in the immediate area, which starts at 7am, so many of the units experience noisy conditions as a result.  This is not going to stop any time soon.",4,0
5/29/2016,Natalya A.,Such a beautiful building right next to traders joe and with equinox inside..it's all I really need! Prices are a bit funky but for the location and the competition are somewhat acceptable. Application process it taking a while but hopefully will come through soon.,4,0

Having moved here alone, I rely a lot on the help of the building so it has been great having a reliable maintenance team.

3/13/2020,San L.,"If you are ""hunting"" for a new apartment in Hollywood,
just take a tour at The Camden.
When you'll visit, you will understand the difference.
The pictures you see on the website are accurate.
Pros:
-The management and leasing team. They deliver a top-quality service here.
They will assist you anytime and are working every day to improve and keep the standing.
That is really important to feel supported where you live, right? And always with the smile: Class!
Jordan, Analicia, Jacqueline, Devon...we're so lucky to have such a team here!
-The units are spacious and gorgeous.
Yes, the kitchen is a real gourmet kitchen with a ton of storage.
They don't pretend to be ""luxurious"": it is luxurious.
-Super clean, modern, well maintained.
I've lived here since 2018, it's a sincere review.
-The building is from 2016. They've already improved and fixed issues noted from the previous years like every new construction might encounter.
-The maintenance team is very prompt and professional.
- 24/7 concierge for you, your guests and packages. Security guards.
-Assigned parking if needed, spacious and safe.
-Location, everything you need is at a walkable distance!
Cons:
-Yes, we had fire alarms, usually on weekends, and caused by people smoking in a non-smoking community, but they are fixing the problem with cameras and eventually evictions.
It's L.A, and unfortunately, it's common in other buildings around too.",5,0
12/4/2019,Zeynep G.,"When we first see The Camden we believe that this is the place we have to live. Enrique, our leasing consultant in Camden was extremely helpful during all the time when we need assistance. Thanks to him the moving process was so smooth. We love you Enrique! :)",5,0
11/19/2019,Elgar F.,"Good evening, This would be my second review for The Camden. I really would like to thank Enrique for helping me and understanding of my situation. He truly handled this major issue with such compassion and very professional. I am very grateful that Enrique took time to sit down and help me set up from my cable,power,and insurance. What I was more impressed by Enrique went out of his way to speak to the companies I buy furniture and set up all the delivery. He saw and understood that my English was not that good and I was having struggle with talking. I was very angry. He totally took the time from his busy day and sit down with me and help me. Honestly Enrique has all what it takes. To give a true customer service. Thank you again and I will see you soon off to Paris I go. I will end this with I recommend for you to come and see Enrique get the hole experience, and you will see what a difference he is from others in other buildings around here.

11/12/2019,Kaan Y.,"I have been a resident now for almost 2 months, and let me tell you I can't not be more happier to have made the choice of moving into the Camden. I really have to thank Enrique because from the moment he came to the lobby till the end of our tour. I was so happy that I ended up applying for my apartment. Enrique was very genuine,friendly,honest,very professional and informative. And the most happiest guy I have ever met. Every time I see him is like the first time we met. And is not just with me I have see many residents come up to leasing office just to say hi, and I'v seen him truly go above and beyond for other resident specially for me. Like this passed weekend I saw him going to speak to residents about the Matt's in the hall Ways. Honestly I thought he was going to get his head served on a platter. But with that big smile and happy professional approached to a resident WOW he got a response that it really showed they like and respect residents have for Enrique. So this is my opinion an experience with Enrique and the friendly staff of me living in The Camden.",5,0

11/4/2019,Baltazar C.,"Hello I am Balta,
I have been keeping my eye on this property for the longest. I will say it is one of my favorites. Many amenities, best pool and jacuzzi. But what blow me away and I definitely left an 5 start impression was the Leasing agent Enrique I have never met someone so professional, genuine, very welcoming and friendly. Most importantly I definitely saw that passion how he presented every area of the building. He was very knowledgeable and very informative. The Camden is really lucky to have an employee like Enrique. Honestly I had to test Enrique with a friend of mine and I wanted to see if he was honestly his personality how he resented him self. Or was he just putting a sales tactic. And come to find out that he treated my friend with the same treatment he gave me. I can't wait to move to the camden and I definitely will be sending all my friends and acquaintances to Enrique because he is truly a delight and what I call true definition of real Customer service. Thank you Enrique for being welcoming and professional in your job we will be in touch really soon.",5,0

8/13/2019,Grace Z.,"My husband and I moved into The Camden in June, and so far our experience has been fantastic. Cat Tignor in the leasing office helped us find our apartment. She went above and beyond throughout the process. After seeing our apartment for the first time, we decided to take the night to sleep on our decision. Cat was kind enough to reach out to us the following morning to let us know that someone else expressed interest in the same apartment. Had she not done that, we would've missed out. I love our apartment! It is in great condition, clean, with brand new appliances. While living in the middle of Hollywood on Sunset and Vine doesn't always offer the quietest environment, I'm still impressed with how well the windows block any outside noise. As someone who works from home, the amenities make the work/life balance super convenient and the staff is always warm and welcoming. Living in a building with so many other people has its challenges at times, but I am grateful to the staff for their transparency, responsiveness, and willingness to stop what they're doing and help when needed.",5,0

6/25/2019,Sabriya D.,"5-STAR quality service from Bruno, the best around when it comes to his attention to detail and constant practice of going above & beyond what's asked of him as it relates to apt repairs and maintenance. I've been a resident of the Camden for three years and since my first day meeting Bruno, I've always trusted him around my personal items and looked forward to our encounters. Case in point, I put a service request in for a simple ice issue in my freezer. I returned home to find Bruno had not only fixed my ice issue, but he also changed out needed light bulbs and cleared a minor drain blockage, all without me requesting him to do so. So grateful the Camden has such an amazing man at the helm!

6/18/2019,Phillip L.,"Everything about Camden has been amazing so far. Only lived here for about a month now, but I really feel good vibes about the whole place & experience so far! It definitely makes the craziness of living in downtown Hollywood seem like you still have your own home oasis you can retreat to after coming home from work or whatever.

Enrique was the name of the agent who gave me a tour, then helped me get into my new place. He is amazing! Such a kind, positive person who has gone above & beyond to help me feel like I'm home here at Camden. He even helped me get set up with someone down at Equinox & a few other things that really displayed he loves what he does here. Would definitely recommend that you take a tour with him when you come in!

Diana was the one other person who helped me with moving in, she was wonderful as well. Along with all the staff in the leasing office & security downstairs.

Such a surprisingly, incredible experience since I have been here in Camden. Lived at 1600 Vine across the street before this for a bit, along with living in many other high rises/mid rises. Highly recommend giving Camden a look next time you go apartment shopping! :)",5,0
6/7/2019,C R.,"We have just moved into The Camden and couldn't be happier. I've had my eye on this community since moving back to California a few years ago and am so happy to finally be here. This is the 3rd Camden property that my family has lived in and I can honestly tell you that by far this one has everything. It's situated near everything you need from Trader Joes being across the street to Bed Bath and Beyond being on the opposite corner. You really can park your car and just walk. I love how the community has tons and tons of features from a real screening room to really nice and clean cooking stations outside if you want to bake a pizza in the pizza oven or use one of the outdoor grills all complete with flat screen tvs for entertaining. Enrique was our leasing host and did a phenomenal job taking us around throughout the property and welcoming us into our home. He answered every question and also took us on a tour of a few additional apartments since we know that we'll be renting a second home here soon in addition to our first one. If you are in the entertainment space, film, editing, music, art, or just need to be near any of the studios for any reason this is definitely your place. There is even a WeWork right across the street however the way the Camden is setup your onsite community and common areas are just as nice if not even more private. We are definitely going to be very happy here!",5,0

12/1/2018,Luis M.,"I've lived in the Hollywood / West Hollywood area for 15 years now and lived pretty much in many of the brand new developments in the neighborhood.  By far The Camden has been the best home I've ever had.  You MUST make it your home.  

It fits my lifestyle perfectly.  The amenities are top notch...from the salt water pool, the theatre, the hub and all of the creative spaces throughout the building...and let me not forget the most convenient way to keep my fit lifestyle with Equinox...which feels like my very own private gym.  

Above all, what makes it feel like home and an ongoing amazing experience are the talented and super helpful staff - Sascha, Brandon, Collette, and Brittany.  Sascha you have a special place on my angels list for all of the runaround and paperwork you've helped me with.  Thank you!  Shoutout to the maintenance staff Bruno and his team as well as Jacqueline, Tatiana and the rest of the security staff.  All of you have always been there to help me take care of any requests.

4/11/2018,Sebastian S.,"My husband and I moved into the Camden in May of 2016, shortly after its completion. While at the time this was intended as a temporary housing solution in the interim of selling our condo in West Hollywood and buying a new one, the Camden very quickly became our home. Over the nearly 2 years that we have lived here, we have been spoiled to the point that we find it very hard to imagine living anywhere else. From the contemporary style and finishes to the myriad of amenities (salt water pool, hot tub, cabanas, movie theater, club house/kitchen, recording studio, dog park with washing/drying stations, patios with pizza oven/BBQs, etc.), anyone will  be hard pressed to find an apartment building of equal standing in the area. Moreover, the presence of a world class gym such as Equinox -- accessible from the building lobby -- makes it very easy to never want to leave the haven of comfort that the Camden boasts right in the midst of the hustle and bustle of central Hollywood. Last but not least, the friendly and helpful staff round out the experience.  The maintenance team is highly skilled and most of them have been with the building from the get-go, so they are rather familiar with the fittings and equipment (Bruno especially is a gift from heaven). The leasing staff is incredibly friendly and helpful -- with the long-standing concierge, Cassandra, being a major asset to the building. The online building portal makes maintenance requests a breeze and also allows you to conveniently make rent payments and reserve building amenities. Moreover, it informs about any upcoming community events -- of which there are plenty --, usually with delicious catered food/drink from local restaurants and wellness treatments offered by the Equinox spa and several other providers. These events are not only reserved to residents but also to their pets, making the Camden an ideal place to be a pet owner. The aforementioned dog park and the washing/drying stations allow you to cater to your dog/cat without leaving the building -- even though it is a pleasure to walk the neighborhood and enjoy just how very far it has come in the last few years. Just steps from the building lobby you will find a fantastic Trader Joe's and enough restaurants (both casual and fine dining), hair/nail salons, bars/nightclubs, fitness facilities (such as Barry's), the Arclight Cinemas and several trendy hotels such as the W, the Redbury and the Kimpton Everly to satisfy your every craving. The building also happens to have arrangements in place with several of these establishments for special pricing/treatment for Camden residents. While I could go on and on about why we feel so very at home at the Camden, I recommend you book a tour and see for yourself!

Peter, Sascha, Brandon and Cassandra are such a pleasure to have overseeing the Camden. Any question you have they are there to help along with any request you may have for them.

8/20/2017,Dominick H.,"I want to first say THANK YOU TO THE CAMDEN HOLLYWOOD. I started my APT journey awhile back with The Camden and to be honest it has been a great experience. Anytime I've a problem it doesn't matter who I talk to I get the same experience. Living in a building with people I can trust on the management side is amazing.

My experience first start with my friends at the Front Desk lobby always being so welcoming when I come into the building.

Josh and Peter thank you for being such an amazing leader and creating the best culture for you team to be able to deliver and be gracious.

Cassandra, you're more than amazing party curator and leasing agent that's be honest, you give the best design advice for a space. When I was doubting my unit you sent me over some of the cutest options to decorate an I will never forget when you came in my unit to measure that Kitchen Island (Who knew she was good with dimension.)

Brandon, always has a smile on his face and the best aroma of energy, like he knows everyone name ""its crazy"". When I go in the office there never a dog that Brandon doesn't great him.

Amanda, that me first of by saying this girl has a wealth of knowledge. Anytime I've a question about my unit or a bill. She always knows the right answer. I love coming in the office to talk with her she's personable and easy to talk with. ""Even when its my fault"".

Sasha, well thank you so much. I recently transferred into another unit and Sasha has always kept me updated on the new leasing rates. She probably showed me almost 10 different units over the last 2 1/2 months. Every Saturday and Sunday it's pool day for me and my friend, Sasha always comes and says hi. My guest always ask, ""Where's Sasha she's the best"" I always have to reply back, ""Working, now have fun"".

These agents make me fell like the leasing office, to the lobby , hell even the hallways is my home.Thank you Cassandra for yesterday and Sasha helping me close the deal. I was considering leaving The Camden(not for a bad reason), But then I realize where I am I going get this type of service, I'll wait............ I am not, I feel like it's personalize service only for me, but then i watch the room and I see everyone get's this level of service.

Well Thank You to another 12 months ,  ""Know know where I'm at, you know where I be""

love always

Residents are very friendly, respectful of each other, and mingle frequently. Management is very responsive, helpful, and pleasant in every way. I would highly recommend the Jardine Apartments.",5,0
11/3/2021,Anna B.,"If you are on the hunt for your next apartment in LA, Jardine is it. I have been apartment hunting for over a year in LA and as soon as I saw Jardine - knew it was the place for me. Every experience you have as soon as you step foot inside: the incredible concierge service, 24/7 valet, gorgeous lobby, apartment layouts, state-of-the-art gym, heated pool & more feels like an A-list experience.

In addition to the outstanding amenities, a huge thing that sold me on Jardine was the community. The concierge staff Markwell, Louise, Juan and Precious bring me legitimate joy. They are the BEST and go above and beyond to help you with anything you need. My move-in process with Markwell was seamless. In addition to the staff, the residents are all so friendly - I've met someone new everyday since living here. Coming out of COVID, finding a sense of community was a big thing I wanted in my next apartment and I'm so happy I found Jardine.

I toured a lot of luxury apartments in Los Angeles before deciding on Jardine and found that most felt really sterile and/or had nice amenities but average apartment layouts. There isn't a single element of my apartment OR the building that I'm not completely obsessed with.

10/25/2021,Rachel S.,Been here for about 2 months now and it has been a great living experience! The amenities and apartment units are beautiful. The resident events allow you to get to know your neighbors and the staff help to make it a fun and inviting place to live and come home to. So happy we decided to give Jardine (and Hollywood) a try. We love it!,5,0
10/24/2021,Tyler S.,"I LOVE IT HERE
Recently moved into this building. Although the view, location, and amenities are what drew me in, the people who work here are what sold me over. Everyone who works in the building is phenomenal. I am especially grateful for Juan, Markwell, Lou, and Nick for being so welcoming and making this feel like home. Everyone who lives in the building is so nice and friendly as well!
Before I moved, I was convinced I wanted to move into a different apartment in the area, I thought it was perfect... I was so wrong. I came and toured Jardine last minute and am very glad I did. This place is amazing and I would highly recommend living here.
I also just love my apartment, it truly is perfect for me. Not only is it beautiful and with an incredible view, but my closet is so spacious! It's definitely my favorite part of the apartment and I didn't see anything like it at any of the other buildings I toured.
All in all, the building is amazing and I have no complaints so far. 10/10 Definitely worth it",5,0

10/21/2021,Noorah A.,"The minute I walked in to Jardine it felt like home. The energy and serenity of the people and place is unmatched.

My priorities when looking for an apartment were security, proximity and amenities. On top of the 24/7 concierge and valet, state of the art amenities and service, Jardine offers a warm sense community. Thank you Precious, Louise, Markwell, Juan, Eddie, Sylvia and team for always going above and beyond.",5,0

7/2/2021,Grace J.,"This is a terrible apartment. I want to move out right now. I started complaining about the smell in the guest bathroom from February and have complained several times. I moved in last Febrary and the smell problem has started since then.They come over to check it out and that's it. It still smells but the maintenance status changes to Done as soon as they returen and they never asked me again if I was ok or if the problem was over. Since then, my husband has complained that the bathroom in the room he was using as his study room still smelled, so I had to block the vents in the guest bathroom and felt the smell was better than before. But after the shower, the fan could not be turned on. After that, the smell problem has now moved to the living room.

A few days ago, the vent in the livingroom started smelling like food waste. I requested maintenance again for both the guest bathroom and living room. One of the maintenance guys came in today with a filter sheet to cover it over the vent in the ceiling of the guest bathroom. However, the smell in the Guest bathroom is coming again and living room smell is getting worst at night due to the high temperature. It's been happening since February and my husband and I have been having a bad experience at The Pearl for almost 5 months. I have an air purifier in my living room, but it doesn't remove the smell because the vents are right above me. I don't think they can fix this issues and I feel they already know this. This is a garbage apartment.

The apartment is built with cheap materials. They advertise this as a luxury apartment, but all appliances and materials are below average. A lot of people say that not many people renew their contracts and I agree with that and I understand why they want to move out of this apartment. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone around.",1,0

Updated review",M.M L.,"I love how my review is ""not recommend"" by yelp now. Even though 5 people have found it useful. It's funny because there are so many 5 star reviews of people that don't even live here just came for a tour but yelp doesn't not recommend those. It just goes to show yelp is ""pay to play"". but for those who actually live here/interested in living here- Update: the pearl claims to ""care for its residents during this time"" and ""wants to minimize contact as much as possible"" - If they wanted to ""minimize contact"" & thats why we have to have parcel pending. WHY haven't we halted the trash pick up? RIGHT- b/c thats mandatory $30 a month. How is everyones trash in the hallway minimizing contact? its so disgusting and horrendous what i have to smell on my way to my apartment and to have to pay for it? so upsetting. This past month I paid $45 for trash ALONE. Additionally, this building has done nothing to help with the current pandemic, not even an email regarding if you can't pay your rent or a discount for not having any amenities. I'm sure they will comment on this review saying that on the lease it says they can stop amenities at any time. So stop the trash pick up. It's useless and a waste of money. RESIDENTS DO NOT WANT TRASH PICK UP. how many times are we going to have to say it for you to care? Stop the BS of ""caring for our residents during this time"" and show us with actions. I.e discounts for no amenities, taking our packages w/o parcel pending, an option for ppl who can't pay rent, removing trash pick up etc.. that is how you show you care for residents during this time not empty words.

Also- If you are lucky enough to be reading this on the pearls main page with all the reviews, I highly recommend going to the ""not recommended"" section which is all the way at the bottom of the page in small letters. You will read all the reviews the Pearl does not want you to read.",1,0

7/20/2021,J L.,"Where do I even begin... I'm not one to write a bad review EVER, but my experience here was so negative that I really feel I need to warn anyone that might be moving in here expecting a ""luxury"" experience.

I was a tenant here for 2 years, and to say this place is ""luxury"" is a joke. While the spaces seem nice and some units even have great views, the management is the absolute worst I have ever encountered.

The building is located in Hollywood, so it's a given that some unsavory things can happen in the area, but the building's poor response to all of these things was beyond a disappointment. For one, we had a gun shooting right outside our door, and the management tried to cover it up, pretend like it didn't happen and make excuses for why they had to close down the entire building, saying it was due to an ""incident in the area"" -- in the area? Then why are there gunshot marks literally right outside my door? Why are there news reporters surrounding our entire building?  Instead of making us feel safe and putting our minds at ease that they are doing everything in their power to ensure the safety of their residents, when the building manager was confronted about the situation, she just shrugged and said ""it wasn't our fault, it could happen anywhere."" Wow, way to make us feel safe sleeping here at night!

We also had personal belongings chained to our parking spot in the garage stolen while we were out of town, and when we asked for video footage to share with the police for the police report, the cameras had somehow mysteriously JUST crashed, and they only had footage from the last few days. Hmmm... isn't that a strange coincidence?

To top off our bad experience, when we finally moved out - I received a huge bill for re-painting the walls and carpet cleaning. We left the place super clean, and if this is such a luxury building - isn't it a given that the building re-paints the walls in between every tenant? Obviously after 2 years of living in a place, there may be minor scuffs on the walls, and I have never in my life been charged for normal wear and tear that comes with living in a place for years. When I tried to inquire about why I was being charged, I got no reply, and literally 2 weeks later, the balance was sent to collections. WTF?? You ignore my inquiry and then try to mess with my credit score? What luxury treatment indeed.

Updated review",Godo S.,"LUXURY - yet affordable ... sleek, modern and stylish ... attentive and supportive management staff is how i would describe this amazing apartment complex especially being the first tenant to move in and also a previous tenant of 8 yrs from the building next door owned by the same managemei have literally viewed and toured at least the top 5 high-end rentals in los angeles and the lofts on la brea shatters the competition aesthetically, on price and more importantly location location location   its central to everything from my gym, the best restaurants and a great place to drop off family who are visiting since its across the street of many tourist attractions  

THE INSIDE - this 2 story highrise and the floor to ceiling windows are its main attractions since natural light floods every room but more importantly being the top corner opens up to the most unbelievable breathtaking views right from your living space and bedroom. The chef-inspired gourmet kitchen is my invitation to enjoy cookin at home and also helps show off the best features of my home.

9/14/2019,Jake T.,"First off, ignore the fake reviews here. The building has not opened yet, and has not allowed anyone to visit - if people are claiming they are excited to be at certain amenities, or whatever else, they are lying. The building is creating fake reviews to counter any negative publicity right now.

More importantly, like the other actual reviews, this building's management has been completely unprofessional and unresponsive. I was set to move into the building at the beginning of September, and then told with little warning that this would no longer be possible because the building had failed an inspection. Staff refused to give a timeline on when they would be set to
actually let people tour, let alone move in. Have tried calling back since - almost every time I have been sent to voicemail. We relied on moving in at the beginning of the month, and have been forced to look elsewhere, and the management seems completely unconcerned with getting the building ready for move in. They are still advertising leasing options and move in dates as if they are ready, which is completely unprofessional and effectively false advertising. Do not trust the management at this location, and do not trust any positive reviews.",1,0
9/11/2019,Ryan S.,"As a person who has to relocate across country because of work, I want to say it's comforting that a business actually is forthcoming and cares.

I love the staff (shout out to Eddy, Shaun, Robin, Daniel, Larry, and Priscilla)--but a particular shout out to Kristin, who on day one sent me a virtual tour of multiple floor spaces while the building was under construction, and who today, almost a year later, still is sincerely invested in ensuring I am comfortable.

1/22/2020,Miguel A.,"I met with James for a tour of the property and by the end of it, I was sure that I wanted to move to the Trademark. James was very professional and took his time to give me a tour of the building and all of the beautiful amenities. The building itself is brand new and gorgeous! The Trademark checks all the boxes for me and even exceeded my expectations.

The Trademark has all the best in amenities and comfort that you could hope for. A beautiful mailroom with a Parcel locker system for receiving packages, and even includes refrigerated units for fresh food delivery. The clubhouse is amazing and very well decorated and even includes a pool table. That leads out to the pool area that is spectacular to say the least. It all looks more like a 5 star resort than an apartment building in the middle of DTLA. The gym has all the latest workout equipment and Trademark even offers a towel service. Pictures don't really do the pool area justice, you have to see it to really appreciate it. The rooftop deck is really amazing too with plenty of space to lounge, great views, outdoor televisons and it even has a dog area to walk your dog!

James was very patient with all my questions and had an answer for every one. He showed me two different apartments/floor plans, each with it's own unique layout. He then gave me a tour of the model which really helped to envision the space furnished. At no point did my tour feel rushed and James really took the time to help me decide which apartment would be best for me.

I have looked at other apartment buildings in the DTLA area and honestly for what you get at the Trademark, the lease prices are incrediblly reasonable and I didn't find any other building that even came close, which is why I submitted an application for my apartment on the spot.

Since my tour, Kristen has been very helpful as well with my application, and I get a sense that the entire staff is very committed to proving excellent service and really, what more could you ask for?

I'm very excited to move in and to be able to call the Trademark, my new home!",5,0
5/27/2019,Jesse P.,Do not move into this building. Elevator is broke ALL the time. Management doesn't return calls or help with anything and is basically non existent.

The building itself had every amenity I needed and everything seemed relatively new/was in great condition, especially the gym equipment. The pool was extremely nice/clean and the refreshment I needed on a few of the hotter days.

To top it off there was this nice rooftop lounge right next to the pool with a gorgeous view of the Hollywood sign (made for some stunning pictures).

4/12/2019,Veronica U.,"I wish I can give ZERO STARS.
I cannot say enough: DO NOT MOVE TO THAT APARTMENT NIGHTMARE!
I moved out about 9 months ago and I am still experiencing PTSD.
It IS true that Josie starts off as your friend but that only lasts as long as she is done using you for a car ride to the market every now and then.
Let me start here:
The apartments at Apartment Nightmare (I choose to call it that for reasons stated below) are sold based on these amenities:
1. Apartments all have washer/dryer. Not true. SOME have them do and if your apartment doesn't have one you are stuck with washer/dryers that break down a lot. And. You lose your money if it gets stuck in there. No apologies.
2. They sell you the idea of a pool and gym.
The pool is cleaned sparingly so tread carefully when entering it.
The chairs are ragged and sometimes, tenants allow their dogs to sit or lay on them. Ew.
3.  The gym is a JOKE. The machines are all dated with a few of them so old that they don't work anymore. If she tries to sell you on that gym, HAVE HER OPEN THE DOOR AND EXAMINE THE MACHINES IN THAT JOKE OF A ""GYM"". You will find that I am not lying. The gym smells like feet after a LONNNNNG day at work, while wearing sweaty sneakers with no socks and running in the rain. Ew.
4. The television doesn't work.
The monitor, she told me, doesn't work. Since the only way to access the gym is through the door leading to the pool, you can find yourself in a scary situation if someone decides to jump over the fence or is let in by friendly tenants. So, with monitors that don't work, you are in deep S**T. I lived alone and worked until 7 pm and the only time I could work out was between 7:30 pm and 8 pm to 9 pm. I always felt scared. I mean, DANGEROUS MUCH???
5. Sometimes the hallway lights go out and it will take days to fix. You will have to beg for things to get fixed over there.
Some of the apartments have issues when it rains. Like wall damage and you need to wear boots damage. I know of a few tenants who had these issues and I truly felt sorry for them. I don't know the extent of the water damage was enough for people to move out. I was one of them. No apologies, no reimbursement of damages, nothing. I should have sued them but I just wanted to get out of there.
6. Go check out the bike stand by the entrance to the lobby if you plan to move there. Some of them have been there so long, the wheels are deflated and they are all dusty.
7. Lastly, everyone gets the same keypad number to enter when I was there. A few tenants that I am still in contact tell me that it hasn't changed. So when someone moves out, if they had a grudge, they can easily give out that number. THIS IS NOT SAFE.

Just listen to me: GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT YOU LOVE. For the money that people pay there (and only because they are being sold on the idea of a pool and a ""state-of-the-art"" gym), it really isn't worth it.

4/18/2019,Xana B.,"I have lived in Valley Apartments for almost two years, and I have enjoyed my two bedroom apartment greatly! It's spacious and a clean environment. Josie the manager will always come to your aid ASAP. The air condition broke one day and she had maintenance come fix it the same day!  Also these apartments are in a great location if you work in the film industry, because it's near all of the studios! True, there is highway noise, but it's just white noise. I highly recommend these apartments!",5,0

10/9/2017,Sean J.,"I recently moved to California and in the process of looking for a place to live, I came across Josie Evans, Resident Manager at Valley Apartments. Up to this point, my experience looking for a place to say had been dreadful to say the least. About half of properties that I came across didn't have Leasing Offices so I was forced to either call and leave a message or send an e-mail in the hopes that someone would get back to me. Needless to say, most didn't.
 I visited Valley Apartments in the hopes of finding a place. Unfortunately, Ms. Evans advised me that they didn't have any apartments available and that for my price range, it would be hard to find something. However, she went the extra mile by taking me into her office and actually looking online and searching for me. She gave me the names of sites to use and even went so far as to check sister properties to see if they had any openings as well as asked a few existing tenants if any of them knew anyone that needed a roommate. All this for a person that she just met off the street that wasn't going to be a tenant. This just doesn't happen every day. I eventually found a place to stay but this simple act of kindness stayed with me. If the world had more people like Ms. Evans, it would be a much place. When my lease is up at my current place, I will definitely be getting back in touch with Ms. Evans in the hopes of moving into her complex.",5,0
9/14/2017,Madeline S.,"I have been living this apartment for almost one year, and I just love this place! First of all, the building is located in a very decent neighborhood in Burbank. People living in the community are gracious and a lot of them are working in film industry. As there is a film school, NYFA, and a couple of production companies, Warner Bros. and Disney, nearby, you might easily encounter with directors, actors, screenwriters and other professionals in the film industry. Starbucks, grocery stores, and restaurants are all within walk-in distance. Super convenient!  More importantly, the unit has a great management team. The manager, Josie, is super nice, warm-hearted, supportive, professional and considerate. No matter what problem you have, she is always ready to help. I believe she makes friends with all the tenants. She greets everyone warmly on every day.  Marcelino, who takes care of all the maintenance, is also super professional, nice and helpful.  He fixes things in a speedy and gentle manner. Never delays. All in all, this is a perfect place for students and professionals, singles and families, cats and dogs. Yes, this apt is pet-friendly.  

230号的这间公寓地理位置绝佳，距离纽约电影学院、华纳兄弟等电影公司都非常近。

小区也很安全、安静和方便，楼下有餐厅、咖啡厅以及Trader Joe's等超市。

价格较合理，有车库，整栋楼打扫得很干净。管理员Josie很热心，愿意帮助住户解决问题，楼内的住户也都很友好。总之非常适合学生或工作族，单身或情侣甚至是一家人入住。",5,0

9/5/2017,Tricia L.,"I've stayed in Valley Apartments for a year and it has been a wonderful experience! The apartment is clean and in good condition (it's always nice to have our own washer/dryer in the unit.) Also, the neighborhood is very safe, no need to worry at night. It's one of the best choices especially for students from NYFA, since that everything is in walking distance! From the day we moved in until the day we moved out, the manager, Josie, has offered us full help. She is very kind-hearted and responsive. I wouldn't have wanted to leave here if my roommates didn't move out. I strongly recommend this place for people who have been struggled with apartment hunting in Burbank!",5,0

Updated review",Lisa P.,"I lived at the Valley Apartments for almost 10 years! Not consecutively....I moved back to the east coast and once I returned to LA, I was so happy with my previous stay at Valley, that I went back and was able to secure an apartment again.  Josie is a gem and made it a pleasure to live at The Valley Apartments.  Amenities, quiet building despite the freeway behind us, on time maintenance request fufilled, perfect location, and safe!!.  Josie as the building manager is fair, fun, and a pleasure to live with.  She loves and takes care of all her tenants...including the animals and it was indeed a pleasure to reside there.   Thank you Josie and valley apartments for a great beginning to my new life in LA",5,0
6/28/2016,Pat N.,Our first friend in Burbank was Josie. She is such an angel. My wife and I just moved out to California from New York and was looking for an apartment. We had such a hard time because we weren't working in California yet and didn't know anybody or where to start. Luckily we found Josie on a Yelp search and decided to call her. She is the building manager at Valleys apartment. She was very nice and invited us over to her office so she can help us more. Unfortunately she didn't have any available apartment in her building but she did give us some websites and contact information from other management office. She would also email us whenever there's new updates or available apartment viewings. We finally found an apartment that would do short term lease. And it was all thanks to Josie because it was one of the property that she had emailed us about. We can't thank Josie enough for all the help that she have given us. Thank you a thousand times!!!!!,5,0
5/1/2016,Kelly S.,"My husband and I recently helped to move our daughter into her first official home which happens to be Valley Apartments and we could not be more pleased at her choice. Josie Evans (Manager) is just a gem...heart of gold and takes immense pride in making sure the tenants are happy. From the beginning to the end of the process, she helped with every detail and made sure that the apartment was as perfect as it could be for her...fixing any problem IMMEDIATELY if it was necessary. Additionally, she has taken our daughter under her care...introducing her to other tenants with similar interests, the mailman and telling her which local businesses to frequent (even introducing her to those folks in the community too!). Every bit of information that we might need to get her settled was at our fingertips simply for the asking. Valley Apartments is, quite literally, a hidden treasure. Great location (at the end of a cul de sac), awesome tenants (who from what we could see are like a family in their own right), safe neighborhood, quiet, clean and loaded with tons of charm and amenities for the price point. You will not be disappointed if you are lucky enough to get in here.",5,0
3/21/2016,Jason W.,"Josie is one of the nicest people I have ever met in LA. During my search, she has gone out of her way several times to help me find the best apartment that accommodate to my needs.
On top of that, she runs a beautifully kept building with a friendly community. I couldn't agree more with all the other reviews on here!",5,0
2/10/2016,Kate M.,"My time spent living at Valley Apartments is some of my fondest memories.  The building is filled with friendly, pleasant tenants that come from all over the world, many to attend the nearby New York Film Academy.  Although filled with friendly tenants, this building has a quiet atmosphere and is best suited for young professionals.  The neighborhood is possibly one of the best perks.  Situated right on the edge of Toluca Lake, you can easily just cross the street to walk in the quiet neighborhoods of mansions and tree lined streets. A very safe neighborhood at all times day and night.  Just a short walk from Trader Joes and Von's, along with many restaurants including Umami Burger and Lemonade.  The pool and gym are always open and often you'll have it entirely to yourself.  However, above all, the best asset Valley Apartments has to offer is the property manager, Josie.  When first moving to LA, she took us under her wing and helped us adjust to the new city.  As a property manager, she upheld all her duties and more.  She will go above and beyond to make your time at Valley as homey and happy as possible.  Highly recommend Josie and Valley. A+!!!",5,0

8/22/2015,Renee C.,"I LOVE my apartment so much! We moved here about 3 years ago from Maryland, so we came in for a long weekend and looked at about 21 different apartments in 4 days (and drove by 10 more). The moment we walked into this apartment, we knew we had found the place. And not just because it was one of the last places we looked at. ;) It was beautiful, spacious, comfortable, and even on a Sunday morning, without an appointment (though we called first), apartment manager Josie Evans was incredibly helpful, gracious, lovely and kind, and so accommodating. She really was (is!) terrific, showing us the apartment and complex, and introducing us to other tenants, including one who proved very helpful in my husband's new career. Josie takes excellent care of us, including our cats, and she loves our cats as much as she loves her own cat. She's so kind to everyone, people and pets alike, and she goes out of her way to help you. I also adore how pet friendly the entire apartment is.

The apartment is so wonderful. It's big and cozy at the same time, and there are rarely problems with noise or smells, and there are no bugs (thank goodness! I've lived in apartments with roaches and it is the worst). My unit also came with a washer/dryer, and even a fridge, which a lot of apartments don't have. Plus parking in a locked garage. And if you do have a problem, Josie takes care of it immediately. They're really quick to respond if something breaks or stops working, and they either fix it or replace it within a few days. It's right near the highway, but I can't hear the noise inside. You can hear it by the pool, but I personally rarely go swimming, so it makes no difference to me. The neighborhood is also wonderful. I feel incredibly safe and there are great restaurants within walking distance.

We really lucked out finding this place. I'm so happy here, I love my apartment so much. I didn't think we would stay here this long already, and I don't plan to move anytime soon. :)",5,0

We could really tell how much Josie cares about the property and most of all people. She was so kind, courteous and helpful. Unfortunately there were not any units available. We really wish there was. It was a real pleasure to meet Josie and we are grateful for the time she took to help us. Thank you Josie!",5,0
7/21/2015,Chris F.,"I was apartment searching the other day and was sad to find out that this building was not available. I was however delighted to meet Josie the building manager who was extremely friendly and professional. Josie was kind enough to take the time and show me around. The building is clean and the apartments are beautiful. I could tell this place was this impressive because of the undeniable love Josie has for the building. Josie was also very passionate about the area. I am new to Los Angeles so it was good to know of my possible surroundings. She said it was a peaceful safe community and that everything I need is in walking distance. After exploring the area I found all her statements to be true. Although I knew I couldn't live there at the time, I felt I was treated like a friend who has lived at Valley Apartments for years. Thanks again for taking the time Josie. Hopefully I can move in when something opens up.

The sounds from other apartments are loud. Run from this place. Management is a joke. I gave my 30 day notice and they can't seem to find it and it's costing me money because the team is incompetent.

4/29/2020,Mirvat G.,"I moved to LA from Europe in November 2019...apartment hunting took more than a month but I didn't like anything I saw, because I'm too picky...
The moment I entered PRIZMA building I knew it was my dream place...it was like a 5 stars hotel...everything was modern and new...very clean everywhere...the staff were very friendly and helpful...the location is one of the best in LA...I couldn't but move in right away with gratefulness to my leasing agent Andrew, who was a big help for me in so many ways.
From the first week I couldn't expect to feel myself as a family member to everyone in this building, tenants and employees.
I unfortunately stayed less than 2 months there then got locked in Europe because of Covid-19.
But I refused to leave my apartment in PRIZMA even if I don't live in it now, and can't wait to come back after this crise.

Updated review",Brian L.,"Just classic. I came back to yelp to see if there was a response to my review. Of course in classic smoke and mirrors style these guys took down my poor review which reads below. That is the biggest problem with these guys. They are not transparent at all and they only want to let you know about the positives and ignore the negatives. Its quite appalling that they took the review down but not surprising given their MO. Yelp is not supposed to be a cherry picking of only good reviews for the benefit of the reviewed. Its supposed to be an open forum where people provide feedback based on actual experience. I will re-post my review and hopefully building management will not take it down this time.

See original review below.

The building itself is ok. Its a little old at this point. The staff doormen and maintenance are really good guys. Management is just ok. They dont work with you at all regarding your renewal. They actually penalize existing tenants and give newer tenants better prices. It makes zero sense but they take advantage of the fact that you are a loyal customer and dont necessarily want to deal with moving. Its not surprising that vacancies are as high as they have been since the financial crisis. There is so much more supply in the area and in the city in general and consumers can see that this  building, as from its location, is just mediocre at this point.

The Biggest issues are the construction that has been going on for a long time and will continue for at least 2 more years according to the construction site manager. The windows are ok but not sufficient to block out the noise of Jackhammers and drills that start at 7am. Also, because the construction is causing lane closures, there is always traffic outside on Houston, Bowery and Second Avenue. This causes ambulances to sit there for long periods of time with their sirens on. Sirens are always there regardless of the construction because Houston is a main artery to get across town but the construction just adds fuel to the fire. Its the most consistently loud apartment building I have ever been in hands down. It's unfortunate that its mine.

Quite frankly the building is unbearable and I would never choose to live here again.",1,0

Where to even begin... the light in my kitchen was flickering for months before they fixed it. The windows haven't been cleaned for years. The idiot in the package room who can't count how many packages you have in the system will ironically count every ""extra"" guest you might have on the roof. There is literally nothing redeeming about this building or there awful management company, UDR. Avoid 21 Chelsea like the British Covid-19 strain.",1,0
5/15/2018,Rick S.,"We had a disappointing move-in experience that, hopefully, does not speak more broadly to the disorganization of the building management going forward.

At move-in, we were provided with a detailed invoice of how much we owe before taking possession of the keys. When logging into the system to pay this invoice, we noticed discrepancies between the online system and the invoice. Specifically, the online system said we owed the full amenity fee (whereas the invoice said we had a half off discount we previously negotiated) and a pet fee (which was voided as ""NA"" in the invoice we were provided). We were confused and had the below email exchange, with dollar figures removed:

Us: ""We just completed electronic signature and submission of the lease. Just to confirm, by what date are we required to make the initial payments outlined in the attachment you previously sent? We logged into the MyUDR system and are noticing the charges do not match what was quoted in your attachment. Specifically, the amenity fee is still showing up as [XXX], and there is an additional [XXX] pet fee that was slotted as not applicable in the attachment (both of which we used as the basis of signing the lease). Could you help us resolve these amounts, and also the timing?""

Leasing Office Employee: ""Regarding payment please refer to your welcome home coast [sic] sheet and not what the website is indicating. You will have to manually enter the amount to make the payment.""

Two weeks after our move in, we get an email saying we did not pay the [XXX] pet fee and needed to make payment. We were confused, given the explicit email exchange above where we had proactively called it out and were told we would actually not need to pay it. We sent this exchange to building management and were provided the following response:

Building Management: ""I can understand the email communication was confusing. Our portal at move in sometimes can seem complicated, so [Leasing Office Employee] would always refer back to the cost sheet. However, she did not update the cost sheet to reflect the [XXX] pet fee. That being said, the pet fee is still [XXX] as per your signed lease agreement and that mount [sic] is due.""

This disorganization is very frustrating, and the explanation that their system is so confusing that their employee doesn't rely on it didn't help things. If we were told from the beginning when we explicitly flagged the discrepancy that we still owed the pet fee, we would have not been upset. However, when you a) are told unambiguously to disregard the amount in the system after you actively bring up the difference, and b) are then on top of that told to manually enter a different amount per a separate invoice saying pet fee is voided, it is very frustrating to then be told you actually owe a higher amount after the fact. It is a bit like telling a cashier ""are you sure about this price because it is posted as different on the shelf?"", being confirmed that yes you should completely disregard the shelf price, then having the store show up at your house 2 weeks later asking you to foot a multi-hundred dollar bill to something you had been explicitly told was voided. The fact that they wouldn't take responsibility for their mistake I think reflects very poorly on commercial professionalism.",1,0

She also made sure that our application process was super quick and our move was seamless and we are now so glad that we've stayed a part of the 21 Chelsea family.",5,0
8/8/2016,Paula E.,"I am just a parent whose daughter moved into 21 Chelsea almost 3 months ago....and as this was the third of my kids to live in NYC, I had a lot of apartments to compare. 21 Chelsea  is absolutely terrific, quality apartments, fabulous  amenities.  The  management  obviously  does an incredible job in maintaining the building and hiring top notch people.
Natalie n the management office was the consummate professional in guiding my daughter and her boyfriend through the process, while making them feel at home from the get go.
She  even let ""Mom"" into the apartment for a sneak peak and to measure before their move in date!
Great place....anyone who finds their way to 21 Chelsea is lucky indeed!!!",5,0
8/8/2016,Ali E.,"I moved into 21 Chelsea 2 months ago and could not be happier. The building and it's amenities are extremely well kept and the staff are over the top nice. It honestly feels like I'm living in a hotel. The doormen, Agron (the super), and Natalie (the leasing agent) are what make the building truly special. Whether it is the doormen greeting you by name when you walk in the door, Argon taking care of any issues within hours of you making a request, or Natalie sending you an email to make sure that everything is up to par, you will quickly realize how above and beyond they go.

After doing a TON of research on the internet, I continued to see nothing but amazing reviews about 21 Chelsea. I had countless discussions with other real estate agents who wouldn't listen to our wants and needs during our search and I became extremely concerned about finding a place. However, the moment we stepped foot in Natalie's office, we knew that we had to live there. She was gracious, kind, informative, and professional. She took the time to show us a few different units as well as the amazing amenities. We filled out the application within minutes and signed the lease just a few days later. The entire process was so seamless, we were convinced it was too good to be true.

I really feel like I've found a home rather than just a temporary apartment. I can't say enough about how great this building and it's employees are. If you are looking for an apartment in NYC, look no further than 21 Chelsea.",5,0

8/2/2016,Anna G.,"I just signed my lease to live at 21 Chelsea for a second year! My roommate and I love it here. There is a great mix of young professionals and families with small children. The rooftop is gorgeous and the other amenities such as the gym and club room are updated and very convenient. Even better, it's a pet-friendly building!",5,0
8/2/2016,Dee L.,We have been in 21 Chelsea for almost a year and it has worked out very well for us.  The apartment is a good size for a one bedroom and the kitchen is very spacious with great (new) appliances.  We love the location as it is near a lot of restaurants and shopping and easy to reach many subway stops.  We are exercisers so the gym is really good for an apartment complex and the views from there and the rooftop are wonderful.  Natalie and Josh (Management Office) were both great to work with when we first visited the apartment and the whole process of getting approved and moving in were pretty seamless.  Natalie has been able to answer any questions or information we needed.,5,0
8/2/2016,Reid T.,"I've lived in 21 Chelsea for 2 months and my experience has been fantastic so far.  The building staff is courteous and responsive, and the facilities are kept in great shape - especially the gym and the roof, which is beautiful.

Natalie from the management office was extremely helpful and responsive during the application process, and has continued to stay in touch in order to make sure we are pleased with our apartment.  This building was the very first that we looked at during our apartment search, and we put in an application quickly after Natalie showed us around.  Highly suggested if you are looking for a clean, quiet building in a great location!",5,0
8/2/2016,Amanda B.,"I've lived in 21 Chelsea for just over two years now. The location is convenient, the building/apartments are newly renovated and the staff is incredibly helpful. The doormen are very friendly and the maintenance staff is responsive and quick. Over the last two years they've made a number of upgrades to the building including a gym on the top floor and resident lounge on the first floor. I also really like using the roof to entertain in the warmer months, it's rarely crowded.",5,0
8/2/2016,Michelle O.,"I moved into this apartment building about 2 months ago and have absolutely loved it.  During the leasing process, Natalie was our leasing agent and she was incredible.  Natalie was super nice, honest, and reliable.  I value efficiency and quick email responses, both of which Natalie had.  My boyfriend and I had many questions from day 1 to today, and Natalie responds right away and in a very professional manner.

We had a couple of issues with regards to unknown smells in our apartment, but both Josh and Natalie were on it as soon as we emailed them and helped fix the issue.  I have nothing bad to say about this place and their agents.  I highly recommend this building, and will continue to live here as long as I can!",5,0
8/2/2016,Stephanie B.,"I moved into 21 Chelsea 2 years ago and I am still pleasantly surprised by the sense of community and how helpful and responsive management is. Natalie Hribko (awesome woman) helped me move into my first unit in the building and when it was time for more space (the big boyfriend move in), she helped me find another PERFECT unit for both us in 21 Chelsea. She was extremely helpful and patient with me as I think I asked to revisit the unit multiple times for measurements.  It was the most effortless, easy move and I am so grateful we were able to stay in the building I love so much. If the roof deck doesn't sell you alone, the building hosts get-togethers, Superbowl parties, wine tastings...as if living in this beautiful building wasn't enough, there are always added sweeteners that always serve as a pleasant surprise.  I would highly recommend this building to anyone moving into the area!!",5,0
8/2/2016,Myra D.,"Just moved into the building a month ago and so far our time at Chelsea 21 has been incredible.

6/20/2016,Dan D.,"21 Chelsea is a great building, in a great location, with very professional management (Josh and Natalie). The roof and gym are good amenities and worth the $$, and always are clean and available. The location near Trader Joes is a huge added bonus.",5,0
1/8/2016,Ilaria A.,"I moved here almost 3 months ago. I love this place.
The rooftop is simply amazing and you get great amenities in the building (gym with beautiful view, lounge area and BBQ in the rooftop, super nice lounge in the lobby for events)

Location is very convenient, I really walk everywhere from here, several stores and markets in only few blocks distance and subway stations only few minutes away.

Personally I fell happy and surrounded by great people. Staff is very reliable and ready to answer to any need or issues.

I couldn't ask for a better place.",5,0

3/17/2021,Giorgos P.,"Perfect location, spacious and bright units with a great rooftop and other amenities. Very helpful management and staff (Dashawn, Danny, Dave), special mention to Yonten at the front desk for being such an amazing and kind person!",5,0
9/10/2019,Y F.,"Have lived here since 2014. Building (previously ""Red Square"") was purchased by a developer and got new management a few years ago. The management is great and very easy to work with. It is a perk having management/leasing available, and they treat tenants with respect (speaking at least for myself). I have realized the value of this over the years, and it does make life a lot easier. ""Shout out"" for Stephen who is helpful and honest.

The building is on a unique corner of Houston Street that was always nice and is getting nicer. This area on Houston Street from the corner of Clinton Street to Orchard Street (by the new Equinox) is one of the best few blocks in Manhattan in my opinion. There is a bunch of storefronts open/opening downstairs such as the Y7 Yoga studio. Trader Joe is a few blocks south and Whole Foods is a few blocks west. Walks to both are pretty enjoyable - again, the building is really situated in a great spot for Manhattan.

Units generally have great views (floor-to-ceiling) and terraces. Most units have pretty clear sight of either Empire State Building views or Freedom Tower views. Again, it is rare to have great views in a ""hip"" part of town in Manhattan. Building also benefits from being built in ~1985 so avoids some of the weird layouts that newer construction tries to get away with. The renovation done over the past few years makes the building feel great. It might be silly, but it is pretty relaxing to come home through the giant glass doors and a welcoming foyer. Door staff is fantastic, including one (Yon Ten) who has been here for a long time and is beloved by current and past tenants, as well as friends, neighbors, etc. Packages never go missing, service requests are always filled quickly by Luis (on site super), building is kept immaculately clean by David, and all staff takes pride in their work.

Tenants are generally pretty great and enjoy living here. It's an interesting mix of people.

New York rents are getting expensive but this building is probably one of the best values in Manhattan thanks to its unique mix of location, views + terraces, generous layouts, and overall vibes. To be honest, it is difficult to move out of this building without sacrificing on something very pleasant no matter how much more (or less) you are willing to pay - whether it is listening to jazz at the Union Market next door, being able to make an Equinox class on time despite leaving your house 5 minutes earlier, sitting at a hip cafe on Clinton Street and running home to get your charger before your coffee is served, or waving to your neighbors from the balcony on a nice summer night, while looking down the Manhattan skyline from Manhattan. Is it heaven? No, but it helps.",5,0
12/7/2017,Anette A.,We basically walked in the building and construction was every where. we met the leasing manager and he was awesome and was up front about everything. He introduced us to the property manager and he was just as friendly. we met the concierge and even some residents and to be honest the people are what sold us - we love it and everything is finishing up and it's going to be spectacular. Brand new elevators and lounge areas - rooftop garden and grills - ah can't wait till summer!,5,0

11/1/2017,Meghan H.,"Moving from Ohio to NYC, I was skeptical of where to move, what neighborhood, and what borough.  I came upon 250 E Houston and was dubious of the building because of the construction.  I met with the leasing manager Stephen {who, by the way is a blast and full of personality :)} I appreciated him more than being fun because he was 150% honest about all the construction and repairs that would be taking place. There are no surprises living at the building. It is exactly what was made known.  
I viewed a 1BR unit with balcony and I am proud to say, I am and have been a resident of E Houston for five months now.  I absolutely love my apartment and the management team. From the manager Charlie, the super Luis who address any and all issues I have had; to the front desk staff all make me feel so happy to come home.

I am content with my apartment pick, choosing 250 E Houston.  

Thank you!",5,0

10/26/2017,Brian A.,"After 3 weeks of getting settled in and meeting the amazing crew at 250 E Houston St, I've found my new home. Stephen and Charlie at the leasing office made the process so simple from the start. The lobby staff have been nothing but friendly and helpful and truly made me feel at home from day #1. They gladly reserved me an elevator and continuously insisted on their assistance, making for by the far the easiest move-in I've experienced.

As far as the actual building, throughout renovations I've been receiving emails ahead of time letting me know of any minor inconveniences I may run into. The first elevator renovation was completed today and I can confidently say it was worth any inconvenience.

On behalf of I'm sure all of the tenants here at 250 E Houston, we commend the staff, workers, and all that have made the living experience here as pleasurable as it's been.",5,0

I was so confident in them, I signed a lease having never seen the studio I was moving into! and I was NOT disappointed. The units are absolutely beautiful and functional.

1/26/2017,Avdienko D.,"Mima is so lovely place ! But today I had strange situation at the Gym Equinox at Mima.
The women who works at the gym (at the entrance) came to me to say that I am not allowed to wear crop top at the gym. I was so surprised. I don't understand why someone tell me what to wear at the gym. And if all sport shops sell this kind of sport wear I think there is reason.
I love sportswear and it is even motivating me to go to the Gym.
And then she said that I am not allowed to take the pictures at the gym. It is crazy.
I am a model I love to Be healthy and in good shape. I like to post the pictures of healthy lifestyle, traveling, beautiful places. I have a lot of followers and traveling a lot. And this never happened to me before. Normally Gym is asking me to post the picture of myself and tag the Name of the Gym. And always happy to see a model wearing nice sport wear. I don't understand why I can't take the pictures( of cause I understand that I should not take the pictures of other people)
I feel uncomfortable to go to this Gym. Feel that someone always look after me to say that I am doing something wrong. Not very nice when you start your day with a workout and someone is stressing you.
I paid for the Gym to be able to do exercice as I want and relax after the work. Not to be stressed.",1,0
5/16/2014,Jen S.,"I do not recommend this place. I've lived in one of the PHs. Good view (It's beyond pricey) but NOT SAFE AT ALL. Once one of the doorman? worker? (I've seen him at M Club and the lobby) of this building  came into our apartment without permission (we do not give anyone permission to enter our apartment when we are not there) and got caught. I went down to the Management Office and spoke with this woman Jocelyn? I think was her name. Extremely bitchy when I told her what was going on. She said, ""Well, that's your problem. Call the police if you want to."" WHAT? Why does Related pay her? Don't waste your doughs. seriously.",1,0
6/12/2012,Mima G.,"If you're looking for a building that is all gloss and no substance, then welcome to MiMA.

Be careful not to have any complaints as it's unlikely they will be taken seriously.

Once you step outside of the marketing hype and actually look at what a gym membership costs, the amenities and exorbitant rent just don't add up.

Now that the building is practically full, don't be surprised to wait up to 15 minutes for elevators on the higher floors and if one goes out of service (which has happened a lot recently), don't be surprised to wait even longer!

The free Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks coffee is just a gimmick. With it costing the building north of $7k per month to provide this, it's unlikely this is gonna last. Regularly the machines are either out of stock or not working and don't get me started on the milk.

If I was pushed to provide a positive about this building, it would be that the door staff are the best of any building bar none. They are real, humorous, understanding and very very courteous. Something their management office may like to take time to learn.

In New York, we have plenty of options when it comes to renting, don't get swept up by the hype about this place, it's just not worth the heartache or stress.

PS: the MTA construction that is happening right outside the building is sure to keep you awake!",1,0
3/14/2012,Veroni C.,I cannot agree more with the child-proof management. My 5-year old son was accused of sexual harassment by the M-CLUB  - since he was with me in the lockers. The Equinox management of the M-Club could not find anything better to do than to complain that somebody of the opposite sex was present in the women's changing area. I tell you - it is not a good place for kids.,1,0
3/14/2012,Anne W.,"Do not recommend this building when you have kids. People with dogs - or singles are safe though.  The M-Club (Pool - fitness, relax area) is the main reason to join the building  - Later we found out it is not to be used by families. You will not be allowed in the common pool, showers, bathroom. You will be watched every step you make. Doors will be locked when they see you coming. Staff is harassing you and changing the rules from one day to another. They are not nice and would make it their mission to make you feel bad. Do not count on using the facilities  - you are simply asked to go to your room. Do not think this is a family friendly building. Women are running bare naked with their children in the corridors - because they could not change clothes in the Pool. It is simply a nightmare.",1,0
3/14/2012,Wout V.,Families in this buidling are not welcome. After 2 weeks the rules of using the pool changed 3 times. Children (and their parents) are denied access to basic facilities in their M-Club and get a lot of additional restrictions with regard to the sport facilities. They are deprived from the use of shower/toilets locker rooms and can not wash themselvels before or after swim. M-Club (stands for MiMA club) makes it no secret they want to get rid of children on their floor - but have difficulties establishing this strategy.,1,0
2/19/2012,Steph G.,"Biggest disappointment and mistake buying into the marketing hype about this building.

Since moving in, we have experienced nothing but problems. Issues with neighbors, issues with noise, issues with drugs, issues with services in the building.

Leasing seem to allow anyone to move into the building and I get that you can't pick and choose who you lease to, but you'd expect for how much they spent on the amenities that this building would be high end, but no. It's trailer-trash chic meets studentville.

Like some of the other reviews on here, the building truly is international which breeds a melting pot of issues. Fights on the basketball court, rudeness in general throughout the building and a management office that doesn't know what it's doing.

The only good thing about the building is the door staff and the fact it looks amazing, although, after only one year of being open, it's wearing badly.

When you move into a luxury building charging high rents, you expect a certain level of service and profile of person to live in the building. Not here, it's like a social experiment loaded with incompetent staff.

Sure, there will be positive reviews, but we are not the only couple who have regretted moving into this building. The only good thing about this whole situation is that our lease is up very soon so we can move away from here!",1,0
1/18/2012,J P.,"As the last person posted, this building is definitely not as great as it seems. Leasing will say anything to get you into the building (word to the wise, get any and all promises in writing!), the building is marketed as pet friendly, but make sure your cat or dog does not make a sound, otherwise you will be served with a Notice to Cure and charged for the privilege. There are many many many more issues with this building which I could cite, but the biggest issue is that for 651 apartments, there are not enough elevators and at times, particularly first thing in the morning, you can wait up to ten minutes on the higher floors.

As a side note, the building is full of ""international"" tenants, (read Korean/Chinese/Japanese) who love nothing more than going between each others apartments on each of the floors, so at times, you would be mistaken for thinking this is China Town, not Hells Kitchen. Second side note, do not consider making the MC Club business lounge your home. Excessive use seems to be frowned upon, despite being advised by leasing that it can be used as much as you like.",1,0
11/1/2012,Richard A.,"It seems that negative reviews about this building get filtered and that's not cool. As someone who lived at this building, it was the worst experience in my 16 years of leasing and owning property.

The building is finished to a high standard in the communal areas, however, once inside the apartment, the only three decent finishes are the floor, bathroom and kitchen. If you're lucky enough to live on a higher floor, you also get the views.

The door staff are flawless, professional and ALWAYS happy to help wherever they can. When it comes to the management office, you would be better off talking to yourself, you certainly would get more sense. The office is staffed with four people and with the exception of one of the team, nothing ever gets done by the others. They constantly send legal notices and charge you for it, fail to collect rent, multiple months at a time and then blame you for it.

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the rules within the building are insane. For the amount of rent you will pay, there certainly are better buildings where your business will be appreciated.

Some of the horror stories that have come out include a flooded elevator bank after a resident broke the sprinkler pipe and it took out the elevator bank. Not great in a 60+ story tower. Recently a snake was on the loose in the condominium part of the development. I'm pretty certain a brothel is being run from one of the apartments as one lady is forever in the elevator with different men, multiple times a day.

It's so easy to get wrapped up in the hype of the building. Don't! There are plenty other buildings in Manhattan. Do your research and ask the important questions before ever signing a lease here!",2,0

I highly recommend and definitely use their service again ( hopefully sooner than I expected) !",4,0
8/20/2014,Burt D.,"We have lived in the MiMa half the week usually for the last two or more years. We also have a home in Nassau County, Long Island where we spend half the time. We decided we wanted to see how we like living in NYC. We have resided in a total of four apartments in the Ultra luxury side of the complex. We kept moving to larger apartments and of course more expensive apartments because we were looking for the ultimate in the building. We now reside in the largest apartment in the building and it is beautiful. We are moving out of the building to the Upper West Side so I thought it was time to write a review.

We absolutely loved every aprtment we resided in here. There isn't a bad view in the entire building. We chose the 460 address side of the building because we wanted better finishings and we are very glad we did. I have had a few issues witrh the Management and no matter how much I may have been an annoyance LOL they have always been very professional and very amenable. Almost every employeee we like very much and we will truly miss the place. The Concierges go  out of their way to make you feel wellcome. At least most of them. I do have problem with a couple of them who really should consider another career but on balance other then an issue or two with the two Concierges the other ones were terrific. I can say that I feel that I have made friends with them and not just a resident employee relationship. They are very well trained and very nice people. Unfortunately they have too many temps working here from time to time.

The Handymen and the Assistant Resident Manager and his associate may be the best in the entire City. The Previous General Manger was terrific and I was upset when he left. The Resident Manager although we have had one difference has been terrific. Anytime there was a problem with the apartments they were right there to fix the issue and we did not have to wait more then usually a few hours. Read that again a few hours, not a few days.

The employees in the Leasing Office and Management Office have never let us down. They are professional and have gone out of their way for us.

The amenities are the best in the entire City with a full court basketball court, and Equinox gym, indoor and outdoor movie theaters, sauna, Steam, grill areas, recreation and party areas, a business center with at no cost coffee all day long, a beautiful swimming pool and much more.

So again we are going to miss this place and almost everyone here including some of the residents that we have become friendly with. Not all of them but many of them.

Now for a few things that I think they need to work on:

We have dogs and MiMa is very pet friendly. However they have not been able to get a handle on some of the residents allowing their dogs to urinate and defecate on or very near the egresses and walls and columns of the complex. I undestand that they may be concerned about losing tenants but unfortunately for people who covet their apartments like we do we walk through it at times and bring it in to the building. It also smells pretty bad especially during the warmer weather. They do powerwash but five minutes later the same culprits do the same thing with their dogs and don't seem to have any respect for their own living environment.

The other issue is the neighborhood. We know that Hells Kitchen is much better now then years ago but it is still sort of heinous and quite filthy. There a lot of tourists and a lot of noise around here especially with all the trucks and cars exiting the Lincoln Tunnel. The back of the building many times is quite a mess and the Covenant House is at the back of the building across the street and many of their reisdents attempt to cause mayhem when they can. They hang out around the back of the buiding at times smoking pot and worse. When we walk our dogs back there it's not good.

So we have decided to move and it has been a difficult decision. The two main reasons is the exterior environment and the dog excrment and this review will not come as a surprise to mangement and I am sure they will know who is writing it. On balance again we will miss the MiMa and maybe one day we will be back. One never knows unless they don't like this review.",4,0

9/10/2018,B C.,These people are thieves and con artists.  Do not give them any information because they will steal from you.

DO NOT LET THEM TRICK YOU INTO FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION.  They believe it is the same thing as signing a lease.,1,0
10/17/2015,Brookie W.,"Renter beware - looks can be deceiving! Sure, Avalon Fort Greene is a lovely building, with nice apartments with terrific views (for now, given the number of high rises springing up nearby), lovely staff, and a great location. However the rent is exceptionally high (though there are worse options in downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene) which leads to lots of college kid neighbors crammed five and six to an apartment, and the accompanying noise and hallway trash.

Worse, expect Avalon to hit you with a monster rent increase when you renew your lease (a trick they pull off by offering you a ""special"" introductory rate, then jacking it up to ""market rate"" plus the maximum increase allowed by New York law in year two.) In our case, the year two increase was 14%. Then, when by the grace of God, you finally find a more reasonably priced place to live and move out, expect Avalon to keep your security deposit -- and maybe even tack on ADDITIONAL charges, regardless of how clean or undamaged you leave the apartment. You will be charged for a full repaint, even if you never changed the white paint color, for wear and tear on the walls and floors, and for whatever else they can think of in order to avoid refunding your deposit.

After living at Avalon for two years, I can only conclude that the company's business model is to grab as much of your money as possible, in as many ways as they can (high rent, fees for amenities that are free in other buildings, like the gym, move-out fees, etc) which of course is the business model of just about every landlord -- Avalon is just particularly flagrant.

The bottom line: the spectacular greed of this company, which operates similar buildings nationwide, should provide ample reason to take your rental business elsewhere.",1,0
9/25/2012,Griifin P.,"This building has been going downhill since opening more than 3 years ago.
I have been one of the first tenants living here -in pre development - and there has never been more disorganization and noise than there is now.  it is so disappointing that management seems to not respond to concerns, as if giving the cold shoulder will solve a problem.  it seems more like living in a construction site than living in a 'luxury' building, and i am so disappointed that while i used to speak to highly of the property, i am now convinced that moving is the only answer.",1,0
4/3/2016,Brian W.,"My wife and I have been living at Avalon Fort Greene for a little over 2 years, and have experienced many pros and cons with this building.

Pros:
- Pet Friendly
- Convenient Location: Close to all major metro lines (2,3,4,5,F,G,A,C,E,Q,N,R), restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops.
- The front desk/concierge is absolutely amazing.  They are always quick to offer a lending hand, or friendly smile.  We've particularly enjoyed getting to know Erdan and Emil further, and after awhile they start to feel like family.
- Maintenance is always responsive and very professional

Cons:
- Constant smell of marijuana throughout the building.  This is largely in part due to many tenants viewing their apartments as dorm rooms.
- Many apartments rent out their places on AirBnb, so you aren't necessarily sure who your neighbors will be.
- Large uncertainties with renewal rate increases. Can range anywhere from 1% to 30% in a given year.

Overall, if you are looking for a pet friendly, convenient location with extremely friendly staff, and don't mind putting up with the negatives listed above, then Avalon Fort Greene is a good viable option.",3,0

2/28/2019,Saz J.,"This is the second time that I've lived at the Avalon Ft. Greene. I love it.  

I'd like to give a wonderful shout-out to 3 people from the maintenance crew.  I don't ever forget how you've helped me.

On one occasion, I believe it was in November 2018, I'd moved an SUV load of household items from many states away (13-hour trip).  I arrived at the Avalon Fort Greene earlier than expected so I didn't have anyone to help me move yet.  Angel from the maintenance crew saw that I was moving items in the loading dock.  He asked if I needed help carrying the items to the loading elevator.  Not only did he carry them to the loading elevator for me, but he then proceeded to ride the elevator with me to my apartment floor.  He didn't stop there. He decided to help me move those items into my apartment as well. He didn't stop there.  He then went back downstairs with me to the loading dock and help me move ALL OF MY ITEMS from the SUV to my apartment.  He was so kind to me.  He made me feel like Avalon Ft. Greene family.  He told me about his wonderful wife and beautiful children as if we'd known each other.  It was just such a blessing.  This is why I keep coming back to the Avalon.  Their customer service is amazing.

Legit you will smell smoke as soon as you walk out either entrance. I hope you love sirens everyday. You will be asked for money at least 4 times before you hit the side walk leaving or entering the building.

Second, the leasing staff may be the most unprofessional bunch of low level narcissists I have ever dealt with. Never have I met such people with so little authority to make decisions acting like they actually know what they are doing when having to make a phone call to a corporate office for every decision.

There is a serious water issue and numerous apts have brown water and they cannot fix it. It is not fair that they are signing new tenants and not warning them of this serious health issue.
The building is not secure. There is no true doorman, and we have a  concierge sometimes. Non residents use our facilities, and have harassed residents.
I believe so many reviews are either inflated or are old. It likes like they have stopped caring now the the building is full.",1,0
5/7/2018,K W.,"WARNING: DO NOT MOVE INTO AVA DOBRO-You'll regret it.

We've been at Ava Dobro for a month now and it's been a rough one. Within a few days of moving in, a hate crime was committed on our floor-dicks and swastikas drawn on a doorway-we are Jewish, so this was extremely concerning. After that, for 3 weeks, we had brown water coming out of all of our faucets. We complained numerous times to management and on the AvaDobro Neighbors Facebook group, but this issue was resolved weeks later! Unbelievable! We have been assured by staff that the brown water is safe for consumption, but it literally looks like feces is in the water. They also mentioned that it was safe for consumption, but didn't recommend drinking it which completely contradicts itself. Since then, the gate at the dog park was broken-we had to call maintenance over 3 times and this issue wasn't resolved for days until we posted about it on the AvaDobro Neighbors Facebook group. Both my fiancé and I were deleted and blocked from the group for no reason. When we asked Jade (head of leasing) why we were blocked and our posts were deleted, he began verbally harassing my fiancé even lashing out with anti Semitic slurs. After my fiancé approached him about the swastikas that were being drawn on doors here, he brushed it off saying ""it's happening everywhere"". That same day, another member of the leasing staff (Megan) publicly humiliated and verbally abused my fiancé-she basically told us that we need to leave the building.

Another issue we've faced is the lack of security in the building. At night, I've waited over 10 minutes trying to find a concierge for help-meanwhile after looking around I've found them in the back room on their phones. This is a complete security risk as anyone could come into the building and you would think that they would be extremely vigilant now that a hate crime has happened on the premises.

Another issue with the lack of security is that someone gained unauthorized access to an apartment and stole a puppy. AvaDobro has somehow covered this up, but basically they're willing to give anyone a key to any apartment and are not concerned about the security risks of doing so-which is why a puppy was stolen from the building. All of these issues have been covered up instead of fixed or revealed to the wonderful people that pay a lot of money to live in this building.

And after all of these issues, the General Manager (Steve) sides with his leasing team over the tenants that are paying $3,000+ to live here.

Just don't move in-you'll regret it. The leasing staff will pretend to care about your concerns, but the reality is that this building is being run by children.",1,0
12/31/2017,Thor C.,"Very disappointed with management. It is New Year's Eve and my roommates and I, and 2 friends went up to the lounge only to find that it is closed for a private event?

Say what?

Why shut out the residents of your building from enjoying the amenities they are paying for, especially on holidays?I can now see in an email they sent out only yesterday that it is closed for a private event. This is an injustice. I think we are going to move out when our lease ends soon, as this is super hypocritical to do something like this to your residents. It shows you do care that you may have ruined countless people's plans on this special night. How much money were you paid for this ""private event"" and was it worth letting the bulk your residents down and disappointing the Ava DoBro community?

Many of our friends in the building are upset too. With so many new buildings opening in the area, we are not going to renew our lease at this rate. How hypocritical can you be Ava team? You can do so much better. Thanks for royally and heartlessly messing up our New year's eve plans.",1,0
9/10/2019,Rachel F.,"The management sends out mass emails about last minute water shut-offs full of typos. False notices and fees on doors addressed to John and Jane Doe because they are too lazy to change the template. The package people are SO RUDE. I don't order anything I don't have to because I dread going through them. I have to wait extra days for them to sort mail, then I show up and they can't find my items. And they tell residents its 'not their problem' and to 'come back later!.' One time they gave my package to someone else and lied about it, and then completely ignored me.

8/2/2016,Steve H.,"This review covers only my two appointments with Andrea K., a leasing agent at AVA DoBro.

*Fast Response*
I emailed and called over a dozen highrises in the Financial District and about six highrises around downtown Brooklyn over a 24-hour period. The AVA DoBro was the first to respond and set up an appointment. Their website (avadobro.com) is quite helpful.

*Andrea*
I visited 11 highrises in the financial district, 5 miscellanous buildings in midtown, and a handful of places in Brooklyn over a period of 3 days. I met dozens of leasing agents in some of the most well-known buildings in NYC (and therefore the world). I spoke with or emailed many, many more. Andrea was by far the most charismatic, and that made my decision to lease at the AVA DoBro so much easier.

*Application*
The application process is fast and easy. The entire application is electronic: on the AVA DoBro website or through email. For me, the application took 5-8 minutes. There are followup procedures, but that is true of any apartment.

If you are looking for an apartment in Downtown Brooklyn or around FiDi, I suggest checking out the AVA DoBro and asking for Andrea. She'll tell you everything you need to know, and answer even the most uneducated questions.",5,0

Despite the dozens and dozens of phone calls and emails we exchanged with Lauren, she was always very understanding and helpful. Any grievances (loud music, mail issues, etc.) are dealt with promptly by the concierges who are always willing to help with anything you need. The maintenance staff is also wonderful to deal with. All requests are usually handled within hours of being submitted. Roman (please forgive me if I spelled his name incorrectly) and Sam in particular are very professional and do an excellent job.

9/15/2021,Antoine D.,"1. Two of the four passenger elevators have been out of service for several months. It can take 10-15 minuets to get up or down the building during rush hour and many times there is a line going out the front door. The building has offered no communication to residents about what the issue is or the estimated time it will take to resolve the issue.

2. The package valet has still not returned to normal hours. If you work a daytime 9-5 schedule; just keep in mind that you will only be able to collect your packages on Saturdays. With these hours I would prefer that there was no valet holding my packages hostage all week.

3. Much of the building is rented as short term AirBnB's. Nearly all the unit 12's are leased by the same short term leasing company that flexes 8 rooms into a two bedroom apartment. The building is aware of how these units are being used and does not do anything to police the issue.

4. A woman was just recently murdered, stuffed into an oil barrel, and wheeled out the front door on a luggage cart by a known gang member resident. Really!

5. They do not protect the walls and elevators during move-ins / move-outs so most of the walls are scuffed and look old and abused and never get repaired.

6. The office staff is extremely slow at responding. They will go days without responding to simple requests and will often require follow up to finally receive resolution to any issues.",1,0

5/26/2020,Sarah V.,"This was my first apartment in NYC and I loved my three years here.  Harold, from the leasing office, made the leasing process a breeze for me and my roommates, especially when we moved into a larger unit within the building. The staff is incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. The doormen make an effort to get to know all their tenants, which really shows in their ability to know guests vs tenants, stopping all guests not with a tenant to check-in at the front desk. Being a twenty-something woman in the city, my parents were always impressed and thankful for the level of security they provided.

The apartments are recently renovated with a ton of light and top notch appliances/finishes. Any issues we ever had with the apartment were resolved within 24 hours.

The amenities are great and well kept.  The rooftop includes grills, which we got a lot of use out of. The gym is open 24/7 and is on the top floor with natural light. The package room/valet offers some of the best prices and customer service around (Mark is the best!!).

The only reason we're leaving the building is it does not offer units with the number of bedrooms we need now - otherwise we wouldn't have thought twice about renewing for a 4th year!",5,0

The whole building has always felt like a safe haven and clean environment; quiet and calm away from all the noise/hustle that is manhattan. everything you need from private family rooms for kids , laundry room for duvets etc are on the 16th floor, transportations/neighborhood has become lively and refreshing with ipic movie theatre/restos/café constantly opening near by/at south street seaport.

3/9/2017,Yessengeldy R.,"I have never posted on Yelp before, to be honest I created this account to thank the leasing team for the help, especially Harold Burrows HBurrows@udr.com! I live in 2325 as of January 2017. He assisted me to sign my lease in under a day! That was a miracle after suffering for weeks with 70 Pine. Honestly his work and assistance is a gem after suffering with bureaucracy of other buildings in NYC. I actually referred a friend who struggled with approval in other buildings and got 500$ as a credit!
Harold is 5 star broker, the building is 4.5!
Although the facilities are good, I have to use back elevator if I have my bike. That elevator is not in the best condition, unlike passenger's elevators in front. Furthermore my apartment had some minor damages on the hardwood floor from the previous residents. I bought a carpet so they are not visible anymore.
Besides this, building is amazing.

2/24/2017,David K.,"95 Wall Street - the hidden gem!

I'm not one to make a review (as you can tell from my history of reviews) however I made it an effort to review 95 Wall Street. This hidden gem offers outstanding amenities, stunning apartments, and an elegant entrance.  But most importantly, as with any home, the people make it livable. I give special recognition to the staff at 95 Wall Street. They make it feel like home. As a returning tenant of the building, and with many options to live in other buildings, it was a no brainer to come back to 95 Wall Street. I want to give special thanks to Harold Burrows for making it such a smooth transition and for his attention to detail. He truly listens and cares about what the client wants, and finds the ""right"" unit for them. He also has a wealth of knowledge about the neighborhood and the property. Also, I commend the manager Josh for keeping 95 Wall Street an outstanding property. I can only imagine how much work it is to keep up with the consistency in excellence.

Hopefully this review offers some guidance when you are choosing your place to live.",5,0
1/25/2017,Emily K.,"I've been at 95 Wall for 4 years and now going on my 5th and I  honestly can't imagine living anywhere else! The units are larger and better laid out than other studios around the city, I love the breakfast served from 630am - 10, the 24 hr gym and concierge, not to mention the valet service with FEDEX and USPS delivery available to take my packages when I'm out of the city. The staff has become family to me and I'm so grateful to call 95 Wall home!

Barbara Wye has been an incredible help moving in this January, it was a difficult process applying from overseas however she's made my move back to New York/95 Wall the most efficient and swift although I had many complication.

9/21/2016,Courtney C.,"My fiancee and I relocated to Manhattan about seven months ago and decided that the Financial District was where we wanted to live. Although many only think of Wall Street when thinking of the Financial District, the reality is that there is so much more! From the endless amount of trendy and delicious food trucks and healthy, affordable food chains, to the overwhelming amount of stylish, hip, young professionals, the Financial District is one of New York City's oldest, yet newest up and coming neighborhoods. Prior to our move, we spent several weeks looking online for an apartment and eventually decided that it would be best to spend a week in New York viewing apartments with a broker. We viewed dozens of properties and they all seemed the same, expensive small units without any views, cold and uninviting lobbies, and basic amenities. Upon stepping foot into 95 Wall St., we instantly knew that this was the place for us! The lobby was warm and inviting, yet trendy and alive with energy. The doormen were not only welcoming and kind, but they were on top of their job in that as dozens of people walked in and out of the building, they knew exactly who was a resident and who was not, which instantly created a sense of safety, being a top priority when selecting a place to live. Being the owners of two large dogs, we found it almost impossible to find a luxury apartment complex that would even consider us to be residents. Upon walking through the lobby at 95 Wall St., we couldn't help but to notice the vast amount of well behaved dogs and friendly dog owners. Although amenities was not a priority, while touring the property, we were amazed with the roof top basketball court, the well equipped gym, the large and stylish lounge, and the in unit laundry. To top it off, 95 Wall St. also provides breakfast to it's residents Monday through Friday in the lounge. There is a one time amenity fee, but it is well worth it, especially for anyone who has a busy schedule and who enjoys the convenience of grabbing breakfast and working out all in the same place. We signed a six month lease because NYC was fairly new to us and we wanted the option to move as we became more familiar with the city and in case we found a better place to live. As our lease came to an end, we knew that 95 Wall St. was our home and we did not have any desire to leave. We signed a twelve month lease and upgraded to a larger unit, where the leasing staff at 95 Wall St. was of much assistance, making the move a smooth transition. We truly feel like we are part of a community here, where all staff members know us and our dogs on a first name basis. There is an online community site, similar to Facebook, where residents have immediate access to everything and anything in regards to living at 95 Wall. St. You can communicate with residents, view and pay your bills, place a service request for your apartment, or speak with management directly. Service requests are addressed immediately and management provides instant feedback and assistance with any questions one may have. Upon reading some negative reviews, I could not disagree more! Yes, there are broker's fees, resulting in the cost to slightly increase, but this is Manhattan and is one of the most expensive places to live in the world and if one does their homework and research prior to moving here as we did, nothing should come as a surprise. We absolutely love living here and I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a fabulous and safe place to live, with a warm and inviting staff that really does make it's residents feel as if they are part of a community!",5,0
9/6/2016,Gillian K.,"I have never had an easier move-in than 95 Wall. Barbara Wye in the leasing office is an absolute gem and I am so thrilled I moved in to the building. From the very beginning, Barbara made me feel completely at home and immediately found me the perfect unit. She even took my parents on a brief tour before I moved in properly! She was very up-front about fees, extended a great special for September move-in, and made it very clear what was necessary for application/approval. After I signed on the unit, she coordinated everything from my service elevator booking to first maintenance requests. I did not use a broker and cannot speak highly enough of the team at UDR.",5,0

6/22/2016,Camila H.,I lived at 95 WALL for 2 years and in my time there I had nothing but great service from the staff and management. If there was ever an issue with my washer or other any of kitchen appliances they would always be quick to respond to the problem.

I would highly recommend this building for anyone looking to move downtown.,5,0
11/17/2015,Jeffrey S.,"95 Wall was excellent to my wife and me (and our 2 year old son).  The entire staff (front desk, maintenance, breakfast staff, valet, management) was WONDERFUL and always held doors for us, greeted us with a smile, and made us feel like it was our home.  Fernando greeted us by name and all of our maintenance requests were completed within 24-48 hours - most were within 6 hours.  

The ONLY issue we had with the building was the rent price.  When our lease ended, the new rent was too high for us, but the leasing office worked with us to try to find a solution.  Sadly, we simply couldn't keep up... but we wanted to stay.

We would highly recommend 95 Wall for anyone interested in a clean building, with fast response times for any maintenance problems, and a FANTASTIC staff.",5,0
2/12/2015,Pollyana C.,"Great place to live in! I only have good things to review on this buildings. Starting from the building itself, its appliances, staff and overall location, close to all subway stations, ferry's, battery park, Brooklyn bridge. For the year living there all porters were always very helpful and kind, packs and mails were in place, amenities, gym always sharp, clean and working. Lounge and open rooftop at summer time, basket ball court are definitely a plus, adding the events at the lounge like wine tasting and others from time to time. Overall you see a lot encouragement for interaction within the building.

Living in this building is truly a luxury experience. 95 Wall was my fifth apartment in New York and was completely beyond compare. I would never have left, except I decided to buy...

The building has a vibe of a 5 star hotel and I love it!  The lounge is so cozy.  Great place to relax or bring your lap top. Love sun bathing in the spring. or   having breakfast in the lounge before work. Great way  to meet your neighbors.  I also love the neighborhood.  very quiet,  close to all subways.  and lots of cute cafes , bars , restaurants. Love the ice skating ring  at the sought street seaport which is only. a 4 minute walk. and in the summer they have a great food court and live music every night. you are one block away from the river where you can go biking.

5/14/2015,Bill J.,"I lived in this dump for two years and trust me, the only thing 'luxury' about this place is the rent.  The worst part about this place is the management company, Milford.  There's a short, fat and very insecure building manager who will thinks she's a landlord in a Charles Dickens novel.  She'll proudly proclaim her title and try to use it as influence when she's as intellectually equipped as a toddler, and emotionally equipped even less.  This woman is accustomed to dealing with slugs and such who are rent controlled, as it's a mixed zoned building.  So while you're subsidizing those worthless passive aggressive Jewish old women who are annoying to share an elevator with, you'll have to tolerate to superior tone of a 'landlord' accustomed to dealing with the dregs but not at all with anyone who can afford their apartments.  They claim to be a family building and I've counted only 4 children in the 100+ units.  They're in the middle of a terrible area with more homeless people than patronable stores, the best thing at that cross street is the food vendor (Sam).  The best part of the building are the concierges, who were excellent.  But never rent at this location unless you want to be supervised and treated like a child by a woman who could never afford to live there.",1,0

The new owner and new super have allowed the building to sink into mediocrity - nothing is clean  - not the hallways, not the stairwells, not the gym, not the elevators, not the sidewalk, nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As a tenant, I can not open my window for a fresh air because of that smoke. It sees that no one cares about this issues. The point is that it is not only discomfort, but also causes ""CANCER"".  I can not leave because I am in a one year lease contract ! I am not comfortable here , at all.",1,0
8/26/2010,Anonymous A.,"Do not be fooled by the aesthetic of this building. While it looks beautiful, they actually used really cheap materials that fall apart over time. In fact, one tenant punched a hole in the wall in the main lobby. Nobody is that strong so goes to show how crappy the materials they used are . You can hear all of your neighbors every move. I know that one neighbor stays up all night watching TV, the tenants above me make so much noise that you would think elephants lived there. The staff is pleasant but there are only one or two who actually do anything for you. The rest stare at you blankly when you are unloading a taxi or come home with heavy packages. The person ""in charge"" in the management office is the worst I have ever seen in a building in my 20 years of living in manhattan. He's rude and doesn't give a shit if you have a complaint. You'll be wasting your time if you even attempt to get something fixed. If your oven is broken, then I guess you'll be eating out more! I wouldn't live here again if they paid me!

4/11/2009,Robert R.,"The GreyStone for many years was an SRO hotel that housed low income people's. It was always a dump with a managment that bordered on the side of criminal.

Eventually most tenets were forced to leave.

Whenever I have requested a repair for example a new lightbulb, the response rate it extremely quick.

In addition, the staff is one of the most spectacular I have ever seen. I have lived in other apartment buildings, and my whole family agrees that Greystone is one of the most accommodating and welcoming places. The location is unbelievable (like two blocks from the express). The gym is in the basement, fully equipped to keep you fit in the city. In addition, there is a lounge area that is so nice, my friends ask me if they can come over for study sessions all the time. It is a super friendly environment, filled with young students as well as some really great people. The people who rent you the apartments are kind and considerate, always saying hi and being greatly welcoming. The management is responsive and very quick, whether its fixing a lightbulb, or if you broke something, they immediately fix it and are unbelievably patient. Couldn't imagine a better place to live, and no matter where I go to work or school, I do not intend on leaving Greystone! I highly recommend this place to live, I wouldn't be as happy in New York without it! It is definitely an oasis of comfort and joy!",5,0

5/27/2015,Prashant S.,"I moved in a few months ago and everything has been smooth since the beginning. The sales staff explained the process clearly and in less than 24hrs I had been approved and shortly after signed the contract and was ready to move in. The building staff is responsive and friendly - they know most of the residents on a first name basis. I moved into a new apartment so there were few hiccups, most were solved by the building staff quickly or outside technicians were brought in. I didn't have to coordinate anything. The building is well managed and maintained, the lobby/common areas are being renovated as I write this. The gym is fine ( enough machines), and is never crowded. The rooftop terrace is a nice amenity. Location could not be better - dozens of stores/restaurants literally at your doorstep. Excellent transport links with express trains running trains running 24hr. Times sq is 10 mins away - door to door. If you like golf, nyc van cortland golf club (the only one reachable by public transport) is a 30 min ride away. Most corners of the city are reachable within 30-35 mins. If you don't mind noisy broadway street then any apt orientation will work, if you need peace and quiet, don't get an apartment that overlooks Broadway. 9/10 experience overall",5,0
5/26/2015,Monalisa P.,"I began my apartment search in the city on Jan 28th 2015 and ended up signing the lease here within 2 weeks and moved in to my unit end of Feb 2015. The application process was super easy and convenient!

Its at a great location: 2-3 minute walk from the 1/2/3 subway, walking distance to Central Park and Riverside Park, many good restaurants and bars in the area, and also close to grocery stores
My unit is a studio- perfect for 1 person and it comes with all new appliances- counter top, lots of storage space, a small dishwasher, large refrigerator and freezer, microwave and oven (what else does one need!) The unit has a new murphy bed to create more space, a walk in closet and all new fixtures in the bathroom, making it even more attractive than the place already is!
As for the building amenities there is a gym, a laundry room, community space with couches, TV and a pool table. You also get access to the rooftop (I havent been there yet, but I will soon and update the review)!
If all this was not enough, here is the best bit: The building staff and the front desk staff are some of the friendliest and helpful I have seen! I don't know how they remember everyones names, but they do, and always greet you and help you out when needed! 24 hour doorman and is a very safe space to live in!

The neighborhood itself is awesome - bars, lounges, and shopping are all close by.  The studio unit fits all of my needs.  For my first experience living in the city it's been great!",5,0
2/26/2015,Stephanie S.,"I had been looking for an apartment on the UWS / Morningside Heights for several weeks with no luck, until I saw a studio at the Greystone. I applied for it before leaving the building.

The apartments have a sleek, contemporary look to them (I especially like the kitchen) and are very new (nice wood floors, bathroom is very updated, etc). The package delivery system emails you when you have a package which is super convenient.  Amenities are great - rooftop, gym, and a lounge area that you can rent out for larger groups. The staff are all friendly, helpful and responsive.

Great location - only a few blocks from the 1/2/3, right on Broadway with lots of stores and restaurants nearby.  I recommend this building to anyone looking on the UWS!",5,0
2/26/2015,Mayur M.,"Thanks to Greystone, my apartment search in the city ended up being pretty short. Minus the smallness of the apartment, everything else was exactly what I was looking for:

Location: It's only couple of blocks from 1/2/3, with plenty of nice restaurants, bars and grocery stores in the neighborhood. Also, proximity of CP is a big plus!

Unit: The apartment have a very contemporary feel to it. The studio units are small, but there is a lot packed into the small space - kitchenette with dishwasher, decent sized refrigerator, to go with two walk in closets (at least in my unit).

Amenities: For me the gym was a big selling point. It's not Equinox (there is one right across on Broadway), but better than a lot of the apartment gyms you'll find in the city. Laundry, Bike room, roof access etc. are great to have as well.

Staff: Especially the folks at the front desk are extremely friendly and accommodating.

It's been a little over 3 months since I moved here and so far I'm very satisfied. Hope it stays this way!",5,0
2/26/2015,Fay M.,"I moved into the Greystone in November of 2014 and I absolutely love living here. The building staff is always friendly and helpful. Additionally, all service requests are taken care of quickly and efficiently. The building itself is very well maintained and offers a variety of amenities. The gym and laundry room are never crowded. I love the location; it's near the subway and a variety of shops and restaurants. I really and truly cannot think of any negative aspects as my experience thus far has been wonderful. I would highly recommend this building to anyone in search for an affordable luxury rental on the Upper West Side.",5,0
2/25/2015,Taj K.,"I moved here 7 weeks ago and so far I Iove it. I live in a studio apartment which is modern and updatded and the pefect size just for me. The amenities are great; the lounge and the gym and the laundry room. Maintenance is very helpful, when I need assistance with anything. The 1,2,3 trains are 2 blocks away. Between 86th street and 96th street which makes this the perfect location for commuters. I do most of my grocery shopping locally at whole foods which is fairly close and Duane Reade.

The lounge inside the building is comfortable and accessible all the time, the gym is small but has all the machines you need, is always clean and never crowded. The rooftop is really charming for spring and summer time barbecues.

Most importantly the staff from agents, to doormen, to maintenance and handymen are extremely nice, helpful and polite!

I would definitely recommend this place as one of the best in the UWS.",5,0
2/20/2015,Kelli K.,"Greystone is a wonderful place to live. I moved into a new micro apartment in January 2015 and cannot say I have been too disappointed for a few reasons:

1) Upscale apartment with modern fixtures
2) Murphy bed to create more space in unit
3) Walk-in closet (may vary by apartment of course)
4) Great amenities - Gym / Community space with pool table, flat screen, & ample couch space / Rooftop deck (open when the season is favorable)
5) Friendly, reliable staff
6) Safe - Fobs are necessary to access gym & community room, 24-hour doorman
7) Laundry in-building
8) Offers dry cleaning and laundry pick-up & drop-off and
9) Access to the necessities near building: Dry cleaning, grocery stores, pharmacies, and 2 blocks from the 96th St. subway station.

There is certainly a high price tag for the apartment, but if you are willing and have the ability to spend the money, you will have a great payoff, especially if you take advantage of all the great amenities and convenience that Greystone has to offer the busy young professional / student.",5,0
2/20/2015,Yu C.,It is a very nice apartment to live! I live a brand new apartment this year and the furnishing style just looks like a great hotel.

The 24 front desk staff are friendly and helpful, any maintenance issue I've had has been fixed instantaneously, its a 2 min walk from the 1,2,3 train and its located in a great neighborhood.

9/17/2014,Olga T.,"I'm in love with this place! I was looking for a new apartment in the city and targeted buildings with facilities like gym and front desk. Moved in here 2 months ago. I want to share the information 'cause I know how hard it is to find a place you can call home in NYC:
1. The best value for money. I avoided $3000 min agent fee for this type of apt because I worked with management directly (located in the same building). Second, I just paid about $100 application fee without any other condo application fees which all other buildings required ($300-$700 on the top of $100).The moving deposit is just $100 and was returned right away. If you meet the standard requirements deposit is only one month which you will never find in such buildings.
2. Moving-in. When I was looking for an apartment with my agent I found Greystone myself and walked in. The application process took 20 min and I had the contract in my arms in a couple of days. Management is super friendly and professional. The apt was clean with a brand new kitchen and bathroom + installed AC.
3. Location! I LOVE this area. UWS is the best place to live. Wholefoods, Trader Joe's, dry cleaners, restaurants, yoga studios, corner shops, pharmacies, different stores, and CENTRAL PARK are all walkable distance from this place!
4. Facilities. New gym with everything you need. I go there every morning. TV, pool to play and the best roof I had so far (sofas, space to suntan, tables to eat outside).
5. Staff. Super friendly, smiley and helpful. We always have our problems solved the same day.

I hope this review helps.",5,0

9/7/2021,Taylor R.,"The Brooklyner is a faux ""luxury"" building where the amenities are almost never all open and the radiators leak putrid mold. I am currently suing them for constructive eviction. They ignored the summons that was sent to them by the State of New York and even tried to hire a debt collector to come after me. The debt collector had one conversation with my lawyer, apologized, and returned the debt to Brooklyner, telling them to respond to the lawsuit against them. It's been a week and still no response. I wonder if they realize it's illegal not the respond to papers served, and even more so to try to collect a debt that you're currently and actively being sued for. They don't seem interested in doing things legally or correctly. Rent at your own peril.",1,0

Updated review",John J.,"Absolutely horrendous and I'm currently suing them for constructive eviction. I had mold issues in my apartment the entire time I lived there and they kept saying there was ""nothing they could do."" My lawyer advised me not to pay rent if the apartment wasn't livable. Equity Residential were served a summons last year and never responded. Found out the other day they tried to sell my ""debt"" to a debt collector. One conversation with my lawyer and the debt collector apologized and told Brooklyner to handle it themselves/it wasn't a valid debt. Three days later and no calls have been returned to my legal counsel. I would appreciate a call back if you're reading this, Equity Residential. Or at least a response to the summons you were issued a year ago to appear in court for constructive eviction. Thanks.",1,0
3/1/2016,Anonymous P.,"While the building is close to many subway lines, in my view, the price is unjustifiable.  If you plan to stay more than one year, don't be surprised by 10-15% hikes in rent.  The building lists a doorman but there is nobody that opens doors or helps with bags, only a person that sits behind a desk.  Walls are thick but doors are thin and from the hallway you can hear in the apartments and vice versa.  
The neighborhood has many convenient stores, however, I wouldn't want my sister to walk around alone at night.  Approximately five times in the last year I have left the building to see people going to the bathroom openly in the street.  If you have a car, expect long waits when picking up your car, sometimes in excess of 15 minutes.  In my opinion, the only good thing about the building is the roof deck view and the gym.",1,0
12/7/2015,James C.,"I'd like to first clarify that I have lived at the brooklyner for over 4 years and I currently still live at the brooklyner, so I've seen a large amount of change since my first year.  Let me be very clear with my review.....DO NOT RENT HERE!

You probably walk in and see spectacular views from the roof top, and great views from your apartment.  You have dreams of entertaining people on the rooftop terrace during the summer and staying there for a long period of time. The only problem is that

-The rooftop is usually rented out at least once a week, but you will get no compensation as a resident for the loss of time for enjoying these amenities

-The rent has skyrocketed but by illegal practices.  It is a rent stabilized apartment but they generally try to force you out every year so they can turn over the apartment.  They also raise it illegally higher than they are supposed to.  Don't believe me?  Be sure to go to this website

metcouncilonhousing.org

or this one

nyshcr.org/Rent/tenantre…

and get the rental history, if they report for the unit that you are looking at [which they are legally supposed to, sometimes they haven't put all the tenants in the report] it you will see that there have been ASTRONOMICAL raises in rent.  

My advice to you is to print out everything and go in to negotiate for 1K below what they are offering.  I'll be sure to make a website about all the atrocities at the brooklyner again.  Everything from Lawris Brown [the former manager who had a floor of prostitutes that he offered low rent to, the 32nd floor] to Justin Scarpa [ the current manager who charged me $100 fee to stay in my own apartment, which I am refusing to pay ]

If you do get a deal on rent, save the money for your eventual tenant attorney and litigation.  Believe me, I am!",1,0
4/17/2013,Dan K.,"I am nearing completion of my one year lease and I won't renew it.  Although the building, apartment amenities and staff is very friendly and responsive, the level of noise in the apartment coming from the street is absolutely intolerable.

The building is located in the middle of MetroTech in downtown Brooklyn and as a consequence noise emanating from garbage truck, heavy machinery, etc is absolutely out of control.  What makes it even worse is the fact that the whole trucks activity starts at midnight and goes on till 5 am every night.  

If you rent in the building make sure to have a hefty supply of ear plugs and/or noise cancelling Bose heavy duty headphones.  In addition, downtown Brooklyn area is absolutely boring with no food, entertainment, etc. and constant view of project dwellers on nearby Fulton Street.

Also, $2,800 that i pay for one-bedroom apartment in downtown Brooklyn you can find an excellent place in the city with vibrant community, great food and tons of stuff to do.",1,0

Ideally situated on a quiet, centrally located street, the building is steps to virtually everything you need to experience the joy of living in Brooklyn.

7/9/2015,Emily I.,"My husband and I lived in the Brooklyner for 2 years and really enjoyed our time there. The location is great for those transitioning out of Manhattan, all the subway lines are within walking distance, and my commute was shorter than some coworkers who live in the city. Every place is going to have it's pros and cons, but some of the negative reviews on here seem a bit extreme. Here's our take:

Pros
-The onsite maintenance team is great. Every request we submitted was fixed within 24 hours, and they were always very friendly.

-The leasing office is also very helpful, in particular Elanna who rented us the unit. We were worried about getting our security deposit back because of some reviewers saying they had theirs unfairly withheld. We just got ours back and we only moved out 3 weeks ago. I've never had a deposit returned to me that quickly in the 12 years I've been renting in NYC.

-Our unit was spotless when we moved in, literally the cleanest apt I've ever moved into. They do a great job keeping the common areas clean as well.

Cons
-I do agree that the concierge aren't helpful. None of them have ever opened the door for me when I was carrying heavy things or trying to wheel a dolly in and out of the building. They literally just sit and stare at you while you try to open the door and maneuver inside.

-There aren't any good restaurants nearby other than some decent chains (Chipotle, Five Guys, etc). If you want something that isn't a franchise, you'll have to walk to Brooklyn Heights or Boerum Hill. (It's not that far, but we get lazy in the winter).

For us, these minor cons were definitely outweighed by the good. We decided to move to NJ to be closer to my family and have more space, otherwise we would have continued to live here.",5,0
11/3/2015,Josh F.,The doormen and maintenance are excellent.  The carpet in the halls is dirty.  They will not replace it.  My neighbor was evicted.  She was in the hospital and I had to take the notice off her door.  The building will raise your rent the maximum amount every year.  My other neighbor had his lease terminated for using Airbnb.  The walls are paper thin.,1,0

2/21/2016,Maria T.,"This building has a ton of problems they need to work through. It's been a year but there are still a ton of growing pains this building is going through. The comments from the other reviewer is just an example.

Here are a few constant problems with the building:
- Elevator problems
- Heating problems
- Fitness facilities, constantly something needs to be fixed
- Response time from the manager and leasing staff is terrible.
- Twice there has been water leaks in the building. This last one completely flooded the lobby and downstairs facilities where they will be inaccessible for a time they cannot tell us
- Security could be better. Only one person minding the entrance. Very easy for someone who is not allowed to walk in the building walk in. I have had several guests walk in unannounced. Most luxury buildings have at least two people downstairs.

This is supposed to be a full luxury building. Especially for the excessive amount of rent Prism thinks they deserve for their units. Take my advice if I have not said it enough, take the time to look elsewhere.  Or check back in another year or two once they get a bit more organized.",1,0
3/18/2018,David R.,"Prism is a promising looking building with a swimming pool and a nice sense of a community, in the lovely neighborhood of NoMad/Gramercy Park / Kips Bay (Park Ave and E 28 St). Management also offers renters an option to break the lease in the first month if something turns up to be unsatisfactory, which I thought was a plus. However, since I was flexible about a neighborhood that would suit me, I ended up opting for a less expensive 1 BR on the Upper East Side in a good looking building with a swimming pool.",4,0

I was instantly convinced, there are few buildings in Manhattan that perform this well on almost every aspect for the price range it's in. The location is outstanding right on top of the six line and near the NQR trains. The area is also lively with numerous restaurants and bars as well as near the Flatiron district. Furthermore, the service is outstanding, never seen something like this in the City. Every employee of the building is polite beyond any expectations in the usually dull NYC. I was impressed by the true concern by the residents well being 24/7. Another great plus is the size of the building, with only 22 floors and few apartments per floor the amount of people is always reasonable, no elevator jams, little to no wait for packages. Lastly, the amenities offered by the building are comparable to any high-end subscription gym. It includes a lap pool, modern machines, weights, spinning cycles and even classes.

4/9/2018,Tom K.,"The apartment is always well maintained, with great staff and a concierge team that cares about its residents. They're very responsive to any request, and make you feel at home.
On the amenities floor, there is everything you could ask for, from screen golf to saunas.
Apart from many of the things you can expect from a top apartment, Prism's location is another huge plus - seconds away from the 6 line and minutes from Madison Square Park.",5,0
4/9/2018,Saad A.,"Prism is a great building!
Pros: Clean, New, Flawless amenities. And most importantly very efficient and kind staff. Sure, the rent can get you a bigger space. But this building is comfortable for the NYC life. Having newly finished apartments means it doesn't get dirty as fast, the air temperature does not fluctuate like in a walk up or older building and the walls are pretty much soundproof. Location, Location, Location. Everywhere that I need to go to, is about a 15 min walk or 15 min cab ride. And if its not, the 6 train pretty much has transfers to most major subway lines.
Cons: ultra modern, for those of you that prefer a traditional or classic aesthetic. Some neighbors are pretentious yet some are wonderful and now I call some of my good friends, so just take your pick :)",5,0

3/2/2017,Neal B.,"I have been a tenant at the Prism for over a year now, and have been renting in NYC for over 10 years in total. I honestly cannot say that I have come across a building that tops the Prism. All of the amenities you can ask for at your finger tips. I go to work, come home and am back in instance paradise. I take full advantage of the gym they have here, its great. After a long workout I hit the steam room for 30 minutes and finish off with laps in the pool (yea, the building has all of this). Since I have been here they have done a full revamping of the staff, and in my opinion, a job well done! The buildings superintendent Wilson is as helpful as it gets. whether it be a routine maintenance request, or a weird favor that I need, he gets it done! He is running a tight ship, and it makes my life MUCH easier. Not having to worry about repairs being taken care of goes a LONG way in NYC (I'm sure you've heard of the horrible superintendents in the industry). If you like this part of the city, the Prism is a no brainer. Highly recommended!!!!",5,0

This is truly the best building in NoMad, hands down. Apartment layouts are cool and maximize efficiency. The best part of living here is the gym and pool, which is never crowded and regularly cleaned (still smells like new). The building staff is also amazing - they are always friendly and responsive. They recently brought in a new community manager, Jordan, which was much needed. The last manager was a total jerk and rude. Jordan, on the other hand, is extremely professional, knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with. She has definitely taken the building to a new level. Highly recommend living here.",5,0
1/24/2021,Lucy W.,"This review is for Sandra and Sandra only. What a nasty woman. Terrible at communicating. For example, asked for an appointment to see some units for a certain day and she says there are none available that day. That's fine, but give me some alternatives? I ask her for times for another day, all she tells me is yes that day is available- but does not include any times. This goes on for a while.

I show up to my appointment, I was running late and felt badly.  I sent her an email 15 min it is prior saying I'd be 10 minutes late and if that was ok, apologizing profusely. No response. I call her when I'm off the subway walking over. She just repeatedly tells me she's booked booked booked and tells me to come before a certain time, which I say I can and will. She then repeats to me how busy she is. I get to my appointment and just the expected nastiness from her. No greeting. Just straight asks me ""what's your price"". I tell her my range, she takes me to a unit and while we're entering I ask. So which unit is this? She reads me the unit number which I can clearly already see on the door, because I have eyes and reading comprehension. Can barely tell me net effective or gross.

Just overall really poor communication abilities mixed with a sour uninviting and nasty attitude. The building seems lovely but her on the other hand, wish I could say the same. You can absolutely find comparable buildings in the area with pleasant staff.",1,0

1/3/2018,Lauren F.,"My husband and I lived here for 2 years. The apartment itself is great (unless you need something fixed, don't hold your breath with the building staff) The appliances are cheap and the apartment is small, but location is great, it is quiet and if you are high enough there is great light.

However be weary of construction around the area -- it was much quieter 2 years ago than it is now.

We had numerous problems with the building staff. Particularly with Jose the main doorman who on more than one occasion raised his voice abrasively or threatened to call the building manager. One time was for a delivery that was unscheduled because we had no idea how big the box was and another was for multiple packages that were left at the front desk which we picked up within 4 hours of delivery.

On another occasion, I reserved the building roof on behalf of my brother in law to surprise my sister and they sent her the contract by mistake, obviously spoiling the surprise. Not only did they NOT offer to comp the reservation fee, but they made no apology.

1 week before we moved out, they sanded and painted the doors over the weekend with 12 hours notice to the tenants. There was an inch of dust under our door when we returned from a weekend away. A stroller scratched the door before we moved out and they took $125 out of our security deposit because they ""didn't want to get in trouble with Rose Associates"" The moment you decline to extend your lease, they look to hit you up for money at every opportunity. It took 3 months to get our security deposit back. They also double booked the elevator the day we were moving out which delayed our move by at least an hour and a half and caused us to pay the movers overtime.

On a positive note, the dry cleaners are great, respectful and always deliver on time.",2,0
1/27/2015,Sarah S.,"we have lived here for almost a year. i have to say we hated it because it was disorganized and it felt like nobody was in charge. then they recently hired a new building manager (Jonathan). he is professional, prompt, and accessible. for those who have lived in NYC apartments, you know those are typically the last 3 words used to describe a building manager. now that he is on board this building is finally a well-oiled machine, and hopefully we can call this home for years. highly recommend it.",5,0
12/7/2018,Daniel S.,"I agree with Ning ma's review, and I too Moved here June 2017 and this place has been a horrible place to call Home. It looks nice and all but this building still has a lot of fixing to do after 2.5 years of being open. 1)THE ELEVATOR Ride is scary, I say a Hail Mary whenever I'm riding, getting stuck hasn't been fun, especially when your uber is downstairs, and Now you're Late for a surprise BDAY Dinner thanks! I must say the maintenance staff is great Ivan is great, leasing is helpful( Garrison and Melissa), the Front Desk staff is Solid, Jean has been by far the most helpful concierge. The guy is always here and works extensively around the clock. BUT oddly his name isn't on the holiday list, and he wasn't in on his regular night shift. Yesterday We ask the Front Desk Supervisor (who mistaken me for a delivery boy on an early encounter when i first moved in, Yes! I didn't forget that Patrick ) why isn't Jean name on the list? He says he found better opportunities. I call BS! . Today they sent a mass email asking residents to run water for 30 secs- two minutes because there has been a big problem with the water lately it's been brown and nasty like...total BS! The worst part is they do not compensate the residents for their mistakes there is always a new excuse or something will be done but take over a couple days to get it done. I hate writing reviews, but this was the day I had Enough! I'm so glad to be leaving as soon as I find a new place. If you're looking for luxury go elsewhere.",1,0

Updated review",Cody P.,"The elevators are constantly broken. Earlier this week, only one worked. Today two are working. Imaging waiting twenty minutes to get down to the lobby. So pathetic. The building manager (Lauren) hasn't even emailed about this latest problem. What a joke. To make matters worse, one of the long term doormen quit, so we have temps on the lobby who have no idea what they are doing. What a secure building!!! Pathetic!!

Update: August 4 -- for the past three days, two or three of the elevators have been taken offline. One day this week only ONE of the elevators worked. Multiple times, an elevator would pass our floor but no one could get on due to the overcrowding.

To compensate, the lovely management crew was serving wine to residents as they walked in the building today - probably to calm tempers!!

Message to Avalon Management: I am contacting corporate leadership. Your negligence is putting residents safety at risk. People are getting trapped in the elevators at all hours of the day. You have bungled the management of this situation and you should consider resigning.",1,0
5/6/2021,Maya R.,"The area around Avalon Willoughby Square has significantly deteriorated as the hotel next door has been converted to sheltering the homeless due to Covid-19.  It has begun to feel unsafe at night as there is constant loitering, smoking, and mask-less yelling directly in front of the doors to the building. They have even shut down the revolving doors as those who did not live here were loitering in the lobby of the building and the front desk did not feel comfortable. Surprised that Avalon has yet to hire a someone to maintain the well-being of not only the occupants but the staff as well. Would recommend living in another area for the same price.",2,0

Updated review",Antonio D.,"It is wonderful to live in a building where there is someone like Brian who works as concierge. Brian is always greeting residents and other people entering the building with a beautiful smile and a genuine warmth that makes everyone feels at home. Brian goes above and beyond to help anyone, even predicting their needs and making sure that everyone that he comes in contact with is happy. A few times that I could not find my keys, without even asking him, Brian left whatever he was doing to accompany me and open the door for me. Brian's customer service is not just about making people satisfied of the services he provides, he has a very good heart and he shows a real compassion and understanding that is rare to find nowadays. When I leave to travel out of town, Brian wishes me farewell like a family member would. He's so authentically caring that I actually feel sad like if I were leaving my own family. But when I come home, Brian is so cheerful in welcoming me back that I feel he's more a friend that a concierge.

2/24/2016,Howard H.,"It's amazing what a fair amount of terrible management will do, and how what seem to be a variety of conflicts of interest, all playing out behind the scenes, have marred what might have otherwise been a reasonably cool building in an amazing neighborhood.

I'd like to highlight some of the more recent trends and also explain what I understand to be their cause. It's hard to really know about cause given that almost none of what's actually going on is ever conveyed to the residents. Like so many things with 34 Berry, it's hard to discern the extent to which that's the result of deliberate obfuscation or simply an incapacity to articulate anything but the most simple of ideas.

NONEXISTENT MAINTENANCE
As alluded to in another Yelp review, the maintenance supervisor seems to be primarily interested in maintaining his interests, rather than those relating to the building and its residents. These include such things as failing to fix a light in the hallway for a long period. Ignoring endless scuff marks and scratches throughout nearly every surface of the building. Allowing the building wifi to be down for long periods. Never fixing a rickety cart. Rarely ever vacuuming the hallways and seemingly never repainting them. Removing carpeting from the elevators, supposedly so that staff have one less thing to clean. Allowing the wipes in the gym to run out and soap from bathroom soap dispensers to go unfilled, even after residents ask for them to be refilled. But then allowing his son to park cars in empty parking spots in the garage. Ensuring that staff have fancy new radios, which they seem to rarely ever use.

The general principle that seems to be applied is reminiscent of the MTA, repair nothing until it's broken, then if repairs are necessary do what is absolutely minimum to restore working status. The general image is of Boss Tweed, another great New Yorker.

STAFF TURNOVER AND CONFLICTS
The door staff have today started a petition of some kind to inform someone else in management about something that they are displeased about but which will affect residents. Whether this petition, if it really even is one, has any chance of impacting anything is unclear. What is clear, is that endless conflicts between building staff degrades the moral of the whole place and seems to create a general feeling of disharmony.

Instead of being greeted by staff who seem happy to be doing their job, the residents are greeted by staff who have a never ending, and ever changing, litany of grievances against their own management. The conflict is also now at a point where the hours of door staff are being minimized to the point that ever fewer services will be provided and provided to a lower quality. The regular staff are also being, perhaps temporarily, replaced by staff from other buildings. This outside staff is entirely unfamiliar with the building and its residents.

Within the last few years, there have been a variety of managers, each with their own good and bad qualities. Their turnover may or may not be a reflection of behind the scenes conflicts, the general theme. Whatever the case, there has been a near total lack of continuity. One manager supposedly didn't like people lounging in the first floor lounge and therefore deliberately allowed the television to go unrepaired for a long period. Another manager made everyone happy with social activities, but then left.

The current manager writes emails on occasion without signing his name. He usually seems to write them more or less as a reaction to something. One resident is upset about ash falling on to their terrace and everyone is then emailed about this. The emails then are long on patchy prescriptions and inane requests, or relevant chunks of legalese, but short on actual informed and balanced policy, such as what someone with a wealth of experience might generate. For what it's worth, his emails seemingly never miss an opportunity to apply a little marketing spin. Our apartments are not just apartments, but ""apartment homes"".

Door staff past and present have included some fantastic people who take great pride in their jobs. They have also included at least one who was often seen sleeping on the job, who some residents claimed was drunk on the job and who residents also claimed removed a Zipcar from the premises for his personal use. It was never made clear, at least to my knowledge, why he eventually left.

LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND/OR TOO MUCH ACCOUNTABILITY
Trivial requests are unnecessarily prolonged and made more difficult, as only certain staff can do certain things, and not all staff are aware of who can do what. This means those who can do things also take long, as they are already loaded up with many such requests, whereas staff who can't do things become increasingly apathetic, to the point of being unwilling to do much more than say that you will have to ask someone else.",1,0
3/15/2012,Rita W.,"I like this building.  Friendly people, happy vibe, great location, decent space.  However, I have to say it looks better than what it actually is.  

They have washer and dryer in each unit, which is awesome.  But the washers and dryers break down all the time.  I have seen many units flooded out by the washers, including my very next door neighbor who told me how he survived the flood.  My washer so far hasn't created any accident, but it turns itself off half way all the time.  That means I can't just set it and leave the house, but instead have to stay and watch to make sure it is running til job is done.   And the dryers tend to have their own mind, either shut down unexpectedly, or never shut down (no matter how you set it) and burn the clothes (my $200 sheets ruined).  They got me a different dryer after that incident, but the new one broke down after a few months.  Now waiting for the 3rd one.

They have a dishwasher, which really helps if you are busy.  However, it doesn't do a good job, doesn't really clean the dishes.  I mean, I have used my mom's dishwasher before, and there's a HUGE difference as to the cleaning power.  I think my mom's dishwasher is more like ""normal"" quality.  The the ones here...not so good...

They have large good-looking refrigerators, but many of them make constant noises that drive me crazy.

I have been complaining, and the answer I received is that the machines are what they are, and they can only swamp the machines from empty apts or their other source of spare units, and see if I have any luck.  And I was told that if I don't have any luck, I should consider buying my own (including refrigerator).  Excuse me?  I am sorry, I am a very easy going person.   Everything else I can live with.  But a noisy refrigerator in a studio is a deal breaker.  I usually fall asleep easily, but this thing is giving me headaches and making me dream monsters who snore next to me during my sleep.

Come on!  With that crazy expensive monthly rent, can you at least get some real functional appliances!!  I have been loving this apartment so far, and done a lot decorating, and even thought about extending my lease for another year.  But the crazy appliances, especially that noise-making refrigerator...",3,0

4/7/2011,Drew A.,"Where to start? I called on an 'apartment by owner' ad that was on craigslist and a few days later I got a call back from a guy named Mike who said the unit was rented but that he had another one I could see. So I thought, OK sure. I show up on some street corner and there is another person there to meet me, Kellyn, who while attractive and nice insisted that I sign a 'client agreement form' before I could see the apartment. I was a little thrown off by this since I had called on an OWNER ad and NOT A BROKER ad. But I had already come across town so I signed the stupid thing. We get in the apartment, and it was OK. Kellyn told me she worked with the owner, but that there was a 'low fee' on this particular unit, which didn't make sense to me. Why would the owner try to charge someone to rent his apartment? If they hadn't been so shady I probably would have rented the place but seeing the other feedback on them makes me happy I turned and ran away!",1,0
3/31/2011,anne c.,"Like many realtors in the NYC market I found City Wide Apartments to be shady. The agent Michaela Alexander charged me a fee for an apartment that I later found out was advertised as a 'no fee'/fee paid by the landlord. Additionally she tried to charge me a few hundred more than what the apartment was listed for online.

She also asked me for cash to cover the credit check. I later found out she charged me additional money in excess of the cost of the building's credit check fee. She is a crook and I would stay away from her and this company.

Our first complaint is that they require a cash only deposit for application fees and do not provide receipts.  Eek!  That should have been the first red flag.  Our second complaint is the manner in which they practice real estate law in regards to tenants rights: in an effort to get us into one of their ""exclusive"" properties they asked us to put a person on the lease who would not be living in the unit, and then advised us to lie during the interview (for the apartment) about this person living in the unit (when they were only making themselves available to us as a Benefactor).

10/13/2013,Anna C.,"Overall, City Wide Apartments served their purpose. We are in a great apartment. But this experience at the end, put a bad taste in our mouths:

The $3500 broker fee was high for us but we were tired of looking and Kristen (who we had a great experience with) made the process painless. We got three cashier's check ($8 fee per check) and went in excited to sign the lease and close.

Mike looked at the checks and told us we were short $300 on the broker's fee. We were surprised and unhappy to hear this. CityWide had given us the number for the broker fee before we got the cashier's checks and we didn't think we should absorb the cost of their mistake. Mike blamed Kristen, laughed at us for several minutes, and trivialized our concerns.

The excitement and satisfaction thinking we had made the right decision to work with Citywide completely dissipated. We reminded Mike that we were his clients and that his behavior was terribly rude and shitty customer service. Mike said he'd  ""send us a gift basket.""  

Obviously, we never expected a gift basket from Mike but I guess that's the point of this story- he's not that kind of guy. Would have been great had he cared enough to prove us wrong though.",3,0

2/13/2014,Maia B.,"I recently worked with Cliff at City Wide Apartments to find a new apartment.  While we ultimately decided to move outside of the city for my wife's job, we had such a pleasant experience working with Cliff.  I have moved in the city several times and had had mediocre experiences until I met Cliff.  He was honest and upfront about everything throughout the process, even if it did not benefit him.  We even liked an apartment that he showed us on Carmine Street in the West Village and debated putting in an application on the place until Cliff informed us that the apartment had previously had bedbugs.  Not only was Cliff upfront about this, but he even took the time to look up this information online.  In case you aren't familiar with real estate agents in Manhattan, that is unheard of!  Once we let Cliff know that we would be moving out of the city after all, rather than just move onto the next client he decided to offer a lending hand with our move if we needed.  

Beyond Cliff himself, it was clear that agents at City Wide are able to use a wide variety of resources to keep clients happy.  If Cliff did not know the answer to a question that I asked, he was very quick to call a manager and find out correct details hastily.  There was an apartment that could only be seen at a very specific time where Cliff was unavailable.  In just a few minutes he had me lined up to see the apartment with one of his colleagues, Michael, who shared the same professional integrity that I had experienced with Cliff.  I truly felt that City Wide and I were on the same team throughout this process rather than the typical ""client vs broker"" relationship that I had previously experienced.  I wholeheartedly recommend Cliff and City Wide to anyone looking for a real estate agent in the city; what a refreshing experience.",4,0

They helped her find an amazing apartment which was why I didn't hesitate to reach out to them for my most recent apartment search.

11/16/2021,Emma C.,"When I saw the apartment of my dreams come onto the market on streeteasy, I immediately reached out to Ari Wilfred who was the broker listed on the unit. While it did take a few weeks to secure the apartment, I was super grateful that he kept me up to speed throughout the entire experience. I was super impatient after living home for over a year during Covid, and ari totally understood. I highly recommend working with him!!!

10/21/2021,Fatteus S.,"After an initially frustrating search, I came across City Wide (thank goodness) and found a great place through working with their team. The events of the world over the past two years forced me to move relocate; and even amidst these volatile times, one of their team (Mo) still found the time to contact me directly. The call wasn't a mere follow-up, but a genuine reaching-out to see how I was doing, what my NYC experience had been and how they could be of assistance on any level moving forward. It's easy to become delegated to ""just a number"" status within the city's Real Estate scene, and it means a lot when a business operates outside of this paradigm. They're trustworthy, dependable & overall straight shooters (no ""hidden terms"", no ""bait-n-switch"") and they have my full endorsement. Needless to say, I just rented my second place through City Wide and I wouldn't think of using anyone else at this point.",5,0

Everything was exactly what I wanted. Sometimes people say ""if it's too good to be true"" it usually isn't. So yes, I was hesitant with Mo. Though it could have been any stranger I had just met. I was told my application was approved and to hand over the lease as well as 2 pretty pricey bank checks (basically cash) to Mo and he would send it all in and assured me they would get back to me by Monday/Tuesday.
"" you don't just hand someone money and get nothing for it..?""
I had nothing to go on. I even asked Mo if he was just going to take my thousands of dollars and change his # and disappear. So embarrassing! Everything was expedited so quickly- I had the keys in my hand by noon Tuesday.

7/16/2020,Ben T.,"My Agent, Nyi Nyi Aung was amazing to work with and made magic happen during the covid pandemic.

I was faced with the challenge of terminating a lease 6 months early right when Covid hit and Nyi Nyi successfully helped me navigate the entire process.  Some big obstacles Nyi Nyi overcame for me:

-Virtual and in person showings with Covid safety protocols.
-Renegotiating a lower monthly rate with my huge (and difficult) management company.
-Negotiating my management to add a free month to incentivize demand.
-Ultimately found someone to take over a very expensive lease during a time when no one wanted to live in NYC.

All in all, Nyi Nyi's hard work saved me thousands of dollars I would have otherwise owed to my landlord. On top of being super proficient professionally, Nyi Nyi is a very pleasant and cool guy who was fun to work with.

5/7/2020,Ngozi N.,"Nyi Nyi Aung is the absolute best! My fiance and I had been searching for an apartment on our own for over a month now and were getting incredibly overwhelmed with the process. Once we started working with Nyi Nyi, we found our dream apartment in less than two days and within our budget!

We really appreciated how patient he was when answering our many questions and walking us through the entire process. He was a great communicator and always made us feel comfortable and that we were in good hands.

I would highly recommend working with Nyi Nyi and am so grateful to him for helping me and my partner find the perfect apartment for our first place together!",5,0
3/29/2020,Milo L.,"My broker was Brandon Ellis. From the moment I met Brandon he was friendly and knowledgeable. He was also extremely positive throughout the whole application process. Anytime I had questions he responded fast and was always able to answer them. It seemed like with him leading the way, anything that could go right did. It was a fast application and lease signing. I would strongly recommend City Wide Apartments for anyone looking to rent.",5,0

1/28/2020,Alexandra R.,"Nathan Warden from City Wide apartments was extremely helpful to me in my search for a NYC apartment. I was very stressed out about moving from California to NYC as I had one day to find an apartment. He responded quickly to my enquiry, showed me the apartment the same day and helped to secure it for me while I was out of state which helped to make my move  seamless. He is professional, polite and overall great to work with. I would recommend him to anyone.",5,0
10/29/2019,Ryn E.,"I just moved to New York from Virginia. I had originally found a roommate and we began looking for apartment all over the city together. We found an apartment we loved (City Wide Apartment), so we decided to put an application down. The broker I was in contact with, Tomi, was incredible. Once we finally had all the paperwork in for this apartment, my roommate up and left the country; leaving me with no roommate and an open application. I spoke with Tomi on the phone and expressed to her how desperately I needed this apartment due to my new job was starting that next week. She explained to me my options and was empathetic towards the issue at hand. I scrambled to find another roommate and was able to find someone to take the second room within 12 hours (a miracle!). I put the new roommate and Tomi in contact and things started to fall into place again. At this point Tomi had been extremely on top of all concerns and questions regarding the apartment; every text, call and email-- any hour. The day we were supposed to sign the lease, the agreement I had with my guarantor fell apart. It became incredibly difficult, frustrating, and overcomplicated. All the while Tomi was willing to do whatever it was going to take to continue to help me get this apartment. Words cannot express how grateful I am to have worked with Tomi. I encountered some horrible brokers throughout my apartment search (not associated with City Wide). Tomi wasn't in it for the money involved, there wasn't even a brokers fee for the apartment. She really cared about helping someone who clearly needed it. There isn't another broker out there who would've gone to the extent that Tomi went to help me. There is such value in personal interaction that is forgotten many times. Tomi truly went above and beyond and deserves, at the very least, the highest praise for being so great at her job. THANK YOU SO MUCH TOMI!",5,0
10/17/2019,Jack M.,Ari Wilford is a fantastic agent. He was very quick at responding to all of our questions and flexible with a meeting time.

I would gladly work with him again in the future.,5,0

10/2/2019,Taylor M.,"If you are working with City Wide Apartments, ask for Annie!

After a long day walking around NYC searching for the perfect studio apartment, I met Annie at my final apartment showing of the day. While the first apartment that she showed me was not the right fit, she stayed in touch with me and reached out to me when another unit became available that wasn't listed yet. I am happy to say that I just signed my lease yesterday and that I am thankful to have had Annie guide me through the application and lease signing process. Annie was very professional, kept in touch with me every step of the way and made me feel at ease in this stressful process. THANKS ANNIE! :)",5,0
9/19/2019,Marc A.,"I don't typically review places, for better or for worse. That being said, I had the pleasure of working with Adam as I searched for my first place in NYC. I have never worked with an agent before and after my experience, I can't see myself working with any other agent going forward. Adam was knowledgeable about the property we were pursuing and went out of his way to make sure all of our needs were met and then some. If he didn't have the answer on hand, he found the answer in a timely manner and passed it on to me. Can't imagine a better experience for finding a new home in NYC. Thanks again, Adam, cheers!",5,0
9/14/2019,Matthew E.,I had a fantastic experience with City Wide! Loubna Pichard assisted me in finding the perfect apartment. She answered all my questions and guided me through the entire process. I would highly recommend her if you are looking for an apartment in NYC!,5,0

8/5/2019,Harrison M.,"Nyi Nyi at City Wide was incredibly effective in helping me sign a lease for the apartment I wanted. As an international from Canada renting for the first time in the US, there are several additional hurdles in the lease approval process. Nyi Nyi was committed to overcoming these hurdles with the landlord and closing the deal. He was very communicative and was easily accessible by phone or in-person throughout the whole process.",5,0
7/28/2019,X K.,"We worked with Jeremiah, who was very responsive and helpful throughout the process. Due to some issues on our end, we ended up taking longer than expected to complete our applications, but he never wavered in responding to us or supporting our application. It was especially nice how he gave us some helpful life/apartment pro-tips that were really useful. Overall, he made the stressful apartment-shopping process friendlier and more pleasant, and we are very excited to move into our gorgeous new apartment!",5,0
7/25/2019,Rebecca R.,"Diamond in the rough! I've been in the city for a number of years now, and dealing with brokers sucks. They're pushy and hard to trust. But Chris Marino from City Wide (and all his colleagues I've worked with) completely changed my perspective. He's genuine, easy-going, super responsive and very professional. It was clear from my interactions with the company that they have your best interests in mind. This is the company to go with if you want the least stressful NY apartment experience out there. And if you have the opportunity, definitely go with Chris!",5,0
7/24/2019,Nick D.,"I don't usually write yelp reviews, but I felt like City Wide and my broker, Nyi Nyi, in particular deserved it. We all know moving in NYC can be a hassle and rental agencies and brokers can be notoriously unforthcoming and difficult to work with. The complete opposite is true of my experience. Nyi Nyi showed me the apartment and was very clear about its features, rental policies, and broker agreements. He was upfront about any application fees and broker fees before we even set foot in the apartment.

Often times after being shown a good apartment, you're overwhelmed with the feeling of panic as the race to get all your documents in order before the other 20 people seeing the same apartment. Nyi Nyi put that concern to bed by asking me to be direct about my intention to rent the apartment and once I did that, he stopped showing it to other renters and very expeditiously helped us gather the necessary paperwork. He was very flexible with my out of state roommate working remotely and with the need for certain documents which are difficult to obtain at a moment's notice. Nyi Nyi was available by phone at basically all hours of the day or night and was very honest and straightforwardly responsive to questions. Thanks for an easy rental experience City Wide and Nyi Nyi.",5,0

5/14/2019,Sakteesh G.,"One of the best agents in the city I have known. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed working with the agent, Ivey. They are very professional, honest and well informed. They are pretty knowledgeable about the building and the surroundings. We got one of the best no-fee deals in the city. Even if it was a no-fee apartment, they were kind enough to negotiate the rent for us with the landlord and got us a fair deal. I can assure that you won't regret the decision to work with them as it's very very hard to find someone like them in this business. I am saying this from my personal experience as I have moved different apartments within the city and have had experiences working with other agents. Thank you, City wide and Ivey. Looking forward to working with you in the future too!",5,0
5/9/2019,Brandon S.,"Ari Wilford is hands-down the greatest NYC agent you can work with. He is an extremely compassionate and knowledgable guy who maintains his professionalism 100% of the time. As an agent myself, working with Ari felt more like getting help from a good friend.",5,0

4/26/2019,Brody E.,"I've actually worked with Ari at Citywide on two separate occasions, three years apart, and through it all he was the consummate professional. I've dealt with around 20 brokers over the years in NYC and he's by far the most trustworthy and helpful. As a client, he took feedback from what I wanted and worked hard to find me exactly what I was looking for even though it was hard to find - and ended up doing even better! No bait and switching, no being pushy just to get to the next client. Plus his exclusive listings are in some of the better landlord buildings that don't raise rent often, with great supers (surprisingly hard to find, it turns out). Then a few years later when I was a tenant and he was showing my apartment, he was always extremely respectful of my time, communicated with me regularly about what was going on, and helped me coordinate with the new tenant. In an environment where most brokers are shady, he's trustworthy. That alone is all you need to know.",5,0
3/8/2019,Stefani M.,We worked with kate young and she made the whole process of finding an apartment very easy. Kate gave us frequent updates and we felt like she always had our best interest in mind. We can't wait to move in and would definitely recommend Kate and city wide to our friends!,5,0
3/7/2019,Holly A.,"Found a great apartment in Midtown East last month. The experience was quick, easy, and painless as possible, considering how difficult and painstaking it can be to find a worthwhile place in NYC.

I was taken care of by Ari Wilford who was there with me through the entire process. Super knowledgeable, attentive, efficient, and personable. I was able to contact him directly through StreetEasy and saw the apartment the first day I spoke to him. He made it a such a pleasant experience.

It means a lot to be able to trust the people involved in the process. This team is experienced and caring, definitely recommend!

11/28/2018,Colin R.,"I really appreciated Andy Rothenberg's help throughout the apartment hunting/applying/leasing process. He answered all of my questions in person at the initial viewing, and really helped me weigh my options and establish my priorities during my apartment hunt. Andy got back to me quickly about each of my follow up questions, assisted with pretty much every step of preparing the documents for my application, and had the paperwork ready to go quickly once I was accepted so that I could sign the lease Friday afternoon before having to leave the city. He also helped me out by stopping back by the apartment to take measurements of the space while I was out of the city (and trying to order some furniture). Andy was never pushy the way some brokers are about trying to sell an apartment to you. Instead, he listened to what I was looking for, helped me evaluate my priorities, and then let the apartment sell itself. Highly recommend him and City Wide Apartments.",5,0

I was feeling pretty frustrated by the search on my own.  Loubna took the time to figure out what was important to me, made it a priority not to waste my time with mediocre choices, and found me a great apartment at the right price.

He never pressured me to view places outside of my budget or places that did not fit my requirements.
Throughout the whole process I had a lot of questions for him (emails, texts, phone calls, etc) and he answered every single one quickly and professionally.

10/30/2018,Rachel K.,"Everyone that lives in New York City knows how stressful apartment hunting can be. I've lived in this city for over 4 years now and have worked with several brokers throughout the years. In my most recent search, I came across Citywide Apartments and contacted them. I received a prompt and courteous response from Michael Patterson. Michael's professionalism, expertise in understanding Manhattan's neighborhoods, and his attention to detail regarding my query was the best experience I've ever had. He was very flexible with his time and was able accommodate my day as well as my after hours schedules. The selection of apartments was well thought out to meet my specified criteria which made the process so much more effective and therefore, so much less stressful than my previous experiences. As a result I am extremely happy with my new home and would highly recommend Michael Patterson and team for helping you find your new home too.",5,0

Mariah was one of the most upfront, honest and helpful agent I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She was always quick to respond to my emails and texts, no matter how often I sent them, and showed us all the options available to us in the building we were looking at in our price range. Her ability to be flexible, yet maintain a sense of urgency with our application, made me more than confident in our decision to work with her.

5/10/2018,Kathy K.,"I've lived in NYC for four years now and have found apartments through several different household brand, larger city agencies and had very dismal experiences. I luckily came across a posting on StreetEasy for a perfect apartment within my budget in a great neighborhood in NoLita so reached out to Anne Kuzbik for a viewing. As I travel during the week for work, it was very difficult to arrange timings to come see the unit but Anne was beyond accommodating and made it work for me. The apartment was exactly what I was looking for so I immediately moved forward with my application process and started gathering the necessary paperwork. Anne helped make this process seamless and easy for me, clearly outlining everything that I needed to send and forms that needed to be executed. She also worked around my difficult schedule to coordinate the logistics and help me get the unit that I wanted. Once confirmed and accepted for the apartment, she has helped me every step of the way with my move...from helping to coordinate my actual move, measuring and sending me the measurements for the unit and connecting me to the property management company.

2/20/2018,Lisa C.,"I've heard lots of horror stories about brokers in New York, which is why I feel incredibly lucky for stumbling across Jeramiah Peay (I don't have any info regarding other brokers at City Wide, but if they're half as good as Jeramiah, they're good). He not only took my bf and I on a well-planned tour to see places in a variety of neighborhoods, but was incredibly responsive and patient throughout the whole process (and I really tend to overthink things and send too many emails).

We gave ourselves a month to find an apartment, but Jeramiah really has his ear to the ground and found us the perfect spot in less than a week. AND negotiated for us, AND acted as a seamless mediator between us and the building management, AND was there for us when the building wanted a thousand different documents (yes, applying for an apartment in NY is like applying for a mortgage anywhere else). Each time I was worried we wouldn't get approved or something wouldn't work out, Jeramiah would keep us optimistic.

He showed me an apartment at 6:15pm and did everything he could to make it possible - even so much as meeting me at Penn Station late night Thursday night to make sure the signed lease agreement could be overnighted to the management company and approved by morning. He was literally with me every panicking step of the way giving me updates and going out of his way to expedite all the necessary steps and paperwork in order to get me (and my guarantor) approved and in an apartment in under 48hours!!

5/9/2017,George A.,"We had the absolute pleasure of working with Yoav as we searched for our first apartment in New York. Yoav is an honest and extremely genuine person, and will do the most for his clients. I received daily (and sometimes even more frequent) updates about the apartment application and leasing process. Especially coming from another state, Yoav was able to help us smoothly navigate the apartment hunt by being available as much as he possibly could be (including weekends and late-nights!). I would highly recommend working with this agency, and Yoav in particular.",5,0
5/2/2017,Dakota K.,Had a great experience with Yoav - everything was as easy as possible. He was able to move around his schedule to meet me at my convenience.  My apartment search was made virtually painfree due to this. Yoav consistently updated me about the status of my application and was able to get me my apartment for a great price. I highly recommend working with him as he will work as hard as he possibly can. Even after moving in Yoav still checked up on me to make sure everything was okay. You are in good hands if you work with Yoav!!,5,0
5/1/2017,Jessica M.,"Hunting for apartments in New York might be very depressing...But I want to thank Yoav for being so helpful, patient, understanding and above all HONEST. I have been disappointed so many times in this city with brokers that I hope YOAV will still be working in real estate in case I need to move again:-)
I recommend you ask for Yoav in your search of apartment. Good luck!",5,0
5/1/2017,James L.,"I recently moved from the UK and needed to find a place to live relatively quickly.  I had contact with various brokers, but Yoav was by far the most helpful throughout the process. He understood what I was looking for and presented the pros and cons of the apartments we looked at.  I appreciated this honesty, and actually ended up going for a different apartment because it was right for me in the short run.  When it comes to looking again, I will, however, be calling Yoav!",5,0

4/30/2017,Carmen C.,"Yoav Irom is the real deal and made finding my rental apartment on Union Square truly a near painless experience. This guy not only knows his business exceptionally well but knew the area intimately. He is a true professional every step of the way and his concern for getting it right was an added bonus. Thanks Yoav for your helping me through this process. You couldn't ask for a nicer, kinder, more genuine guy in a a real rough and tumble business. I couldn't recommend him more highly. He will find what you need and as close to what you can afford as is humanly possible. And in the process, you'll meet a real gem.",5,0
4/30/2017,Bradley C.,"Yoav was extremely helpful throughout our apartment search. Quick to respond, but you never felt that he was rushing you or the process as a whole. His work is valuable and it shows in the way that he treats his clients.

If you have a chance, let him show you around! He made sense of a complicated NYC apartment hunt for some out-of-towners.",5,0
4/30/2017,Natra A.,"Yoav is amazing!This was my 5th time moving in the city and he made it the easiest apartment hunt! I couldn't make up my mind he went out of his way to show me the same apartment twice. He was so personable and quick to text back or call. In fact, I was out of town for most of it and he coordinated with my boyfriend and I so seamlessly! He's totally straight forward and honest about the apartments he's showing. When that 6th move comes I'll definitely be calling Yoav!",5,0
4/30/2017,Donna D.,"Yoav is extremely knowledgeable, very helpful and truly cares about his clients. He has seemingly boundless energy and simply gets it done right.

4/29/2017,Joseph B.,I met with several other brokers (non Citywide) before getting in touch with Yoav. He was by far the most helpful and down to earth broker I've worked with.

Highly recommend working with Yoav,5,0
4/29/2017,Gabby I.,"I worked with Yoav Irom to view an apartment on the UES and was blown away by how approachable he was. Yoav is an excellent listener and was able to understand what my needs were when looking for an apartment. He is a great communicator, and very honest and trustworthy.

I would 100% recommend City Wide Apartments to anyone looking for an easy, smooth moving process.",5,0
4/5/2017,Kevin L.,"Small shop, excellent service, great coverage in manhattan. My broker was Jeff D, extremely knowledgable in UES and many other neighborhoods. He's responsive and extremely accommodating; he'll give you great insight on the current market which is important, as well as historical rent costs. Jeff was more of an advocate that helped us lock in a great deal versus how you normally view a broker.

The bottom line is: these guys are honest and they don't make you feel like you're being pressured into a decision. They won't show you buildings you're not expecting to see. They'll give honest feedback as no building is really perfect if you're under some budget.

They've worked hard for their reputation and they're continuing to add value in this softer market.",5,0
3/29/2017,Francesca C.,Worked with Anne she is so great. She worked really hard to make sure we got the apartment we wanted even when there was another qualified application. She also answered all of our questions at the lease signing. She even wrote us a personal thank you note and congratulated us on our new home. She and CityWide gave us a little congratulatory gift upon signing too. Classy touch. They even donate $25 to charity from each deal they do. How great is that? So pleasant to work with and really would recommend everyone search for their apartment with Anne and CityWide. My aunt and my mother who came to the lease signing with me were very impressed by Anne's professionalism and general attitude. Anne was also so responsive to a gagillion emails I sent her and never complained. She and CityWide have so many connections and work with a lot of great landlords that have amazing apartments. We love ours and it was a great deal.,5,0
2/22/2017,Andrea K.,"Hunting for an apartment in Manhattan can be a daunting task, but luckily my boyfriend and I came across City Wide Apartments early in our search.

She was caring and honest from the moment we met her and never pushed us in a direction we did not want to go.

10/21/2016,Kate R.,"I'm a repeat customer having worked with Michael from City Wide twice. The first was when I needed to find an apartment in two weeks and Michael found me the perfect place in a matter of days - it was in budget, had plenty of amenities, and he made the entire process as painless as possible. Most recently, Michael saved the day when I had to relocate and break my lease. He immediately jumped in, helped deal with my building's management company, provided guidance throughout the process, and, most importantly, found a new tenant to take over my lease - all in two weeks! Michael is the answer to all your NYC apartment prayers - and he is a great partner, listens to what you want /need, and overly communicates.",5,0
8/3/2016,Arielle P.,"I recently rented an apartment from Jeff at City Wide Apartments. He was awesome and made the process so easy. Renting an apartment in NYC can be overwhelming but he was able to find me just the right spot. He brought me in to the office to meet his boss and discuss all my options and simplified the whole, sometimes stressful, NYC apartment hunt. He was very professional from beginning to end and I will definitely be recommending him in the future.

So happy in my new place!!",5,0
7/29/2016,Nina P.,I worked with Michael who was extremely professional and knowledgeable about the market and what apartments fit my needs/wish list.

2/19/2016,S C.,"after looking for an apartment for the last four months, Ryan Saxton of City Wide apartments is by far the best broker i have worked with. Working with countless brokers, Ryan was always punctual, with good energy and cared that much to get the best apartment for me within my restrictions. Ryan is an exemplary real estate agent.",5,0
11/19/2015,Sarah R.,"I was relocating from Georgia and literally had one day to find a place. I contacted CityWide through a friend of a friend who had an amazing experience finding a place only a year earlier. I was set up with Ryan Saxton...he's WONDERFUL!! That Friday we looked at 7 or 8 different places, all of which were right in line with what I was looking for. I ended up signing papers that day to get the process started on my apartment...which I love...then jumped on a plane back to Atlanta. Ryan was extremely helpful throughout the whole process. Since everything post the choosing of the apartment was done with me being out of state, Ryan played a huge role in making sure that the process went smoothly and that everything was taken care of without issue. He even went back to my apartment after all the paperwork went through to take more pictures and measurements for me. The best of the best! I highly recommend Ryan and CityWide!!",5,0

""Collin Medford and the CWA team for all of your real-estate needs""

There's nothing more nerve-wracking and stressful than apartment hunting in New York, a process made all the worse by impatient or greedy or straight up rude brokers. Thankfully, there's no need to lose faith in humanity or give up the search for that perfect apartment, because there's Collin. He helped us secure a dream apartment at the last minute, negotiating with the owners on our behalf and going well above and beyond anything I would've expected from a broker.

He was incredibly knowledgeable about the neighborhood, very quick to respond to messages, and remarkably good at moving the process forward without being a pushy salesman, and-- throughout it all-- was so relatable, friendly, and cheerful, he was more like a friend than a broker. Once the paperwork was handled, Collin even came back to help measure rooms and layout the apartment with us - just awesome service.

Collin is entirely in a field of his own. He is, quite simply, the best in the business and we will be using him for years to come.

Thanks!",5,0
10/20/2015,Julie C.,I was desperate to find an apartment after looking for 2 months without any luck. My broker Chad was able to find me a wonderful apartment in a great neighborhood in my price range. He was reliable and professional. He kept in contact with me through the entire process until I was completely moved in. I would highly recommend Chad if you are looking for a great apartment!,5,0
10/20/2015,Allie C.,"My room mate and I had a great experience working with city wide in our apartment search. Our broker, Jessica Ekstein went above and beyond for us. Jessica took our search criteria into consideration (tight budget, location, etc) and in the end found us a great place. She was really focused, friendly and most importantly patient with us. Her colleague Michael Patterson was also a great point of contact. I will definitely recommend using city wide to all my friends and family in the future!",5,0
10/17/2015,Gabrielle S.,"After reading a review by ""MC"" recently in the City Wide YELP feed, which was brought to my attention by someone I referred to City Wide, I felt compelled to write a review of my own (although I do not normally use  as a place to air grievances or bestow compliments).

I recently worked with one of the brokers at City Wide named Cliff who along with the management team there was completely transparent, honest and diligent in his efforts to assist me.  I was able to find, with his help, an apartment for my family at a price within my budgetary constraints and was charged a reasonable fee for the service provided (well below what I have paid through other brokers).

Additionally, it is noteworthy that Cliff did not waste any of my time.  He was able to locate and schedule apartments for me to view apartments within a few hours of me contacting him, one of which I rented as it met and in some cases exceeded my requirements/expectations.

It can be a jungle out there in the city trying to find an apartment; City Wide is one company you can really trust to help you find a new place to call home.

I would not believe every negative review you read .. there are lots of crazy people in New York.",5,0
8/11/2015,Ryan G.,Just to give a little background- my two roommates and I just graduated from college in North Carolina and we're looking for an apartment in New York to fit all three of us. We worked with Owen McCafferty and it went really smoothly! He was constantly available via email texting or phone calls. My roommates and I were all working full time so he was really accommodating to our schedules. It was our first apartment in the city so we didn't really know what we were doing or what documents we needed. He walked us through the whole process and helped us put together our application packet. He was even nice enough to walk our parents through the guarantor's forms since they had never filled one out. Would definitely work with him and City Wide Apartments again!,5,0
3/12/2015,Jacquie R.,"My roommate and I were searching for an apartment and had been through the ringer with different brokers. We had all but given up by the time of our last appointment. It was Jessica whom we immediately clicked with. She was friendly, helpful,  and clearly communicated to find out exactly what we wanted in an apartment and did not push for what we didn't want or what was out of our budget. Even though it was a snowy, February day in NYC Jessica did not give up until we found exactly what we were looking for. My roommate and I are comfortably settled in our new place and couldn't be happier. Thank you so much Jessica! I would recommend this group of people searching for an apartment in the city.",5,0
11/21/2014,Jon R.,"I've lived in NYC for a while now and have moved a few times all using a different broker.  Every time I deal with a new broker he/she has never been honest regarding fees nor actually put in the time to find an apartment that met my criteria.  With my most recent move, I was introduced to Mike and Colin and Citywide and they were awesome.  They were not only upfront regarding feeds, but actually had extensive knowledge regarding the RE markets and certain areas to be looking into.  Would definitely utilize their services again.",5,0
10/9/2014,Sara P.,"I recently moved to NYC and was recommended through a friend to try City Wide Apartments and I can say I was more than pleased by their service and efforts. My broker, Jessica, was extremely personable, friendly and understanding of my situation. Not only did she show me a number of great apartments but went out of her way to answer my questions at any time of day with immediate and helpful service. My situation was unique in the fact that I am Canadian with no American credit score or American guarantor - needless to say it added quite a challenge to find a landlord that would accept me as a tenant. Given all this extra strife, Jessica and the team at City Wide Apartments managed to find me some unbelievable choices in a timely fashion. Cant thank them enough for all their help!",5,0

Updated review",Jason P.,"City Wide Apartments found me a great UES apartment in 2012. It was a fully renovated 1 bedroom with marble bath, walk-in closet and brand new stainless steel kitchen. And the price was way below market value. It has worked out great.

Fast forward to 2014, and I needed a new place. I called up City Wide Apartments again, gave them my requirements, and a few weeks later they found me another fully renovated apartment matching all my requirements.

Worked with owner Mike J. and broker Eric E. I highly recommend these guys.",5,0
4/2/2014,Kelsey C.,"I recently worked with Michael to find a new apartment in New York.  This is my first time living in the city and needless to say we were a bit nervous.  My roommate and I weren't sure whether we wanted to live in Manhattan or Brooklyn, and thankfully Michael was willing and able to help us look in both areas.  

We ended up taking a place in Midtown East that he recommended.  Once we moved in, we realized lucky we were to have Michael's advice.  The apartment completely exceeded our expectations once our second bedroom was partitioned (this was a 1 bedroom converted to a 2 bedroom).  Our friends can't believe how lucky we got!

I recommend City Wide and Michael to anyone looking for an apartment.  Michael and his company were honest, efficient and extremely helpful!",5,0
3/31/2014,Tara M.,"Jeff R. was a pleasure to work with and made the NYC apartment search super painless! He really went above and beyond - making sure to always check in with us throughout the process and was there on move-in day to help set everything up (moving boxes, etc).

We told Jeff what type of apartment and he was able to show us spaces that fit our budget and all of our criteria and got us a great deal! The apartment was completely gutted when we first looked at it but Jeff assured us of the process and end result. He went to the apartment to check on it during construction and constantly kept us in the loop.

We now love our apartment and are very happy! Jeff R was a fantastic broker and we would definitely recommend working with him.",5,0
3/14/2014,Amanda S.,"Mary was by far the most pleasant person I've met in the business. I've worked with a ton of brokers through different experiences and Mary was just pretty much awesome. Professional, compassionate, organized, quick responses, accommodating, and enjoyable to be around. We met with her a number of times and shared more than a few good laughs.

2/12/2014,Deren D.,"Recently moved within Manhattan. I hate moving and wasn't looking forward to it at all after hearing how much of a hassle it is in the city. We worked with Jessy Ekstein. She is really nice and goes out of her way to help you at every step. The whole process was fast and smooth. We didn't have any neighborhood preferences so we let her run wild and it turned out all good. Communicate what you want in an apartment  thoroughly and she will find the ideal spots for you. Good experience all over, I would definitely work with her and City Wide again!",5,0
2/9/2014,Robyn M.,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Jeff R from City Wide Apartments and couldn't have been more pleased. My son and his friend had worked with a different broker/agency and were all set to move into a NY apartment they found. Four days before their scheduled move in date, I asked this ""other"" broker via email a question on a sentence or two in the contract about my being a guarantor and I also asked if the boys could expect whatever was broken in the apartment to be fixed within 2 weeks from the move in date. This same broker said the building owner no longer wanted to rent the apartment to the 2 boys and that in the future they should just ""sign the lease and not ask any questions."" This left me in total shock as my son's friend had already given notice to his landlord and literally would have no where to live in 4 days. I looked frantically on line and found good reviews for City Wide. I called and was told not to worry and that they would send me a list of available units for immediate move in within an hour or two. True to their word, the list came and the next day Jeff R showed us 3 nice apartments. I cannot say enough nice things about working with Jeff R. That same day, we signed paperwork and the next day they were approved and moved in on time. He was directly responsible for finding the apartment and following up with all the details to be sure everything went smoothly. He found them a wonderful apartment, within budget and in a much better neighborhood than where they were originally going to move into. I would highly recommend Jeff R to anyone looking for any type of real estate in NYC.",5,0
9/3/2013,Max G.,"I've had nothing but a good experience with City Wide.

After being shown the apartment we decided was the one for us, my roommates and I found it very easy to follow up and begin the process of getting our application in and signing the lease.

Chad Rosow, our broker from City Wide, was extremely professional and responsive in acting as an intermediary between us and the leasing office. He was also helpful in negotiating a lower fee between us and his boss.

7/23/2013,Kristen R.,"I recently made the decision to move back to the city but wasn't at the point of looking at places yet. A friend of mine recommended Jeff R, who was AMAZING! Super supportive and honest, just a really down-to-earth, tell-it-like-it-is kind of guy. I didn't feel the icky pressure that a lot of brokers exude when trying to close a deal. He was amazing with the apartment, helped get in touch with the current tenants about furniture they were leaving behind, made sure I met the Super with him and has checked in to make sure everything is OK. I even had an issue with plumbing on the weekend and couldn't reach the Super and he was so helpful and willing to do whatever he could to assist. Definitely THE person you want to help you search for your new home! I will definitely use him again if I ever move, and have referred him as my TOP broker in NYC to anyone looking for someone!!",5,0
7/21/2013,Boris K.,"NYC is probably one of the more difficult cities to find an apartment within your budget quickly.  My buddies and i did a few weeks of extensive searching through craiglist, streeteasy, and a bunch of greedy brokers.  You will be surprised how so much can get you so little in this city.  Anyway...Trekking across all parts of the city we were just about to give up when were fortunate to run across Mary with City Wide.

Mary knew the ins and out of all the neighborhoods and was very professional.  Not only did she help us with our search she was so easy to talk to and really cared about helping us find the right place within our budget.

We found a place within a few days and signed the lease within 24 hours. We are just so grateful for City Wide and Mary and have been living here without any issues for over 5 months now.  100% recommended.",5,0

7/16/2013,Noelle T.,"I've lived in NYC for a long time, and leased several apartments in the past. Finding a new place has always been a nightmare, so when I started looking this spring, I expected another horrible experience.

One of my good friends, who has had similar experiences, referred me to Jeff R. at City Wide Apartments. Jeff went above and beyond to make this the most seamless apartment hunt I've ever undertaken. He quickly figured out what I was looking for, and managed to find me an apartment with everything I wanted and more. Better yet, it was actually in my price range. I honestly don't know what I would have done without Jeff and the team at City Wide. They made apartment hunting a pleasure, and helped streamline the lease application process. Plus, Jeff did an amazing job negotiating with the other brokerage and management company to get us a great terms on our lease.

If you're looking for an apartment in Manhattan, I highly recommend letting the all-star team at City Wide be your guide!",5,0

6/13/2013,Sherry M.,"When I moved to NYC, I moved in with a friend, so my relocation was painless and easy. This time moving, I knew that I would most likely have to go through a broker, and, based on the stories my friends had told, was not looking forward to the experience. After seeing a few apartments, my roommate and I started a game of picking out brokers and clients on the street - spotting the brokers was usually pretty easy, and most of them weren't people that we particularly wanted to pay to let us into an apartment. When we met Mary from City Wide, we were expecting the same type of thing, but she surprised us by being a down to earth, non-sketchy, normal person.

Mary showed us the apartment that we had responded to - the actual apartment, not a tiny, old apartment that looked nothing like the pictures in the ad. She explained what we had already begun to figure out - that a 3 bedroom downtown in our budget was hard to find - and we ended up applying that day. Mary helped us prepare the best application possible, and was even able to negotiate a lower fee for us (even though I'm assuming that cost her money). I will definitely recommend City Wide to any of my friends who are moving (although I don't think they're going to get as good a deal as we did!).",5,0

1/31/2012,Nick K.,I was referred to City Wide Apartments and the agents were very helpful and understanding of my situation. I needed to find an apartment quick. I was shown a bunch of different apartments until I saw one that I really liked. Everyone worked really hard to get me into my new apartment as quickly as possible. I am very pleased with the service I received from City Wide Apartments and would recommend them to anyone looking to move.,5,0
8/26/2016,Donald J.,I have been here for a few  years not and I really don't like it too much. I find the management to be pretty bad and slow to answer requests. When I moved in I was so happy with the view of the Empire State building I had now an ugly hotel is being constructed obstructing my view. The view from the roof it very nice however seems like always that people are drinking and getting drunk on the roof top so it kind of ruins the peacefulness of the experience. Funny because there are cameras on the roof also. This is a tell tale sign that someone is not doing their job. The doorman seem nice but  I see they are not too friendly to minorities in the building. If you are over 50 like me I would not recommend you living here.,1,0
11/19/2013,Isabella D.,"Pros:
1) Close to public transit
2) Doormen are good
3) Decent layouts

Cons:
1) Management/leasing is completely, totally, utterly unresponsive to everything
2) Rooftop bar across the street makes it a dance party in your bedroom every night
3) Project Runway filmed here - extra people, noise, congestion, inconvenience
4) Block is a staging area for parades - absolute craziness on weekends
5) No supermarkets or restaurants anywhere close
6) Construction noise ALL DAY & NIGHT!!!!
7) Elevator to tenant ratio is insufficient, long waits
8) Appliances are old & cheap and walls are thin
9) Light bulbs and smoke detector batteries are your cost/responsibility
10) Small gym at extra cost (about $25)
11) Minimal/No storage in bathrooms and water pressure poor",2,0

4/22/2021,Susan K.,"I've lived here for the past three years and my parents the past two years. We've had a really great experience living at the Atlas. The apartments are very clean, quiet and spacious, especially for NYC standards. It's located in a busy part of NYC with easy access to restaurants, Whole Foods, Bryant park, train lines, and K-town. I've gotten to know all the staff members (Tom, Steven, Carlos, Elvis, Byron, Danny, many more) and they have all been super friendly and helpful. It really seems like a family here.  Every maintenance request has been addressed in a prompt manner. One thing that needs improvement is the speed in which they are renovating the elevators. They have been renovating the elevators one at a time (four total), which leaves 3 working elevators. This has led to long waits for the elevator, but this is just a minor annoyance and still doesn't take away from the great experience I've had living here.",5,0

11/13/2020,User P.,"The Atlas building is amazing! The staff, amenities and residents were incredible. I made some very close friends in the building through the community events, rooftop concert series, and exercise classes.

The apartments are very spacious and clean, and they have beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows. There is a lot of natural sunlight, which is hard to find! The units also have a good amount of closet space. The floors were not overcrowded, and I rarely heard my neighbors. The rooftop has a beautiful 360 view of the city and the community events in the building organized by Atlas and Gotham Concierge were very fun! These events included an outdoor concert series, cocktail / whiskey tasting, cooking demos, and fun events for kids and pets. The gym has a lot of equipment and the exercise classes were really good. Pierre Fils-Aime's Circuit and Bootcamp classes were incredible (even better than classes at my gym) and he helped create a great community.  

During the pandemic, the staff has gone above and beyond. They cleaned the elevators and common areas multiple times a day, delivered packages and food to people's doors if they got sick, and were extremely helpful. The maintenance staff was very responsive and the whole team worked to make people feel safe during a difficult time. Tom, Elvis, David, Byron, Carlos, Anthony and the whole team were fantastic. One challenge was that the laundry room was closed for maintenance for a few months during the pandemic, but it is now working again.

Overall, I highly recommend the Atlas building!",5,0
11/11/2020,James P.,"I've Lived here for two years and the apartment is generous size and very quiet. I was expecting some noise as it is located right on 6th avenue.

Atlas is a wonderful building in a central location in the city.  This location is perfect for work and play as it is near so many transport links. The wholefoods nearby is convenient for grocery shopping which is rare in midtown Manhattan.

The entire staff is friendly, accommodating, helpful, and knowledgeable - including concierge, maintenance, etc. They go out of their way to help me.

Communal areas are clean and promptly maintained. The interior is modern and with quality amenities. The rooftop has a phenomenal view and the organised social activities are always appreciated.",5,0
11/9/2020,Sam J.,"Through 9 apartments over the years, I've never written a positive review for a building or mgmt company since in NYC most of them are no good, but I need to give credit where credit is due - Atlas is a great building to live in. The onsite staff at Atlas are A+, and everyone at the front desk is just fantastic. Could not ask for nicer people. During COVID, I felt like staff and management went above and beyond to keep things sanitized and orderly, and we really appreciated their hard work. Building mgmt was quick to respond to emails and on the rare occasions we've had to have something fixed, the response has been fast. The only downside I experienced was the laundry room being out of service for an extended period of time, but that was more of a city DOB issue than an Atlas issue so I don't hold it against them.

The building itself is nice, with the 360 rooftop being it's main selling point. Apts have ample closet space which is appreciated. The gym is good, the yoga classes offered were awesome, and all in all it's been a very nice building to live in. Before COVID, they would also do seasonal events too which were cute. I would definitely recommend Atlas to anyone apt searching around that neighborhood.",5,0
6/27/2020,Giovanni C.,"We've been living in Atlas for a few years, and liked it so much that we recently moved to a different unit within this building. Moving in the midst of a pandemic wasn't easy, but Olivia and the rest of the staff have been incredibly helpful through the move. Not only does the building have an amazing team, but the apartments are comfortable, the amenities are great, and it's fairly priced for this location. We highly recommend this building!",5,0
6/27/2020,Renee L.,"We have lived at the Atlas for more than a year now and it has been a phenomenal experience. The facilities are clean, the staff have been transparent and diligent since the COVID-19 crisis started, and overall you can tell that Atlas (and by extension, Gotham) have taken everyone's safety and health very seriously. They clean frequently and the building residents have been respectful as well. The staff are extremely helpful, quick, and go above and beyond! They have a great policy that allows you to upgrade in the middle of your lease without penalty, so when we decided to move into a bigger place they made the process seamless. They were accommodating with the lease start date, since we had to travel back from visiting family out-of-state, despite having other interested renters. It's been a pleasure working with them! Don't hesitate to move in! Also, anything you need in the city is steps away.",5,0
6/18/2020,Stephen W.,"I would like to thank the Concierges and Maintenance workers at the Atlas for being so courteous and professional during this time of the pandemic and prior. I feel safe, respected and taken care of, Hats off to this great team.",5,0
6/10/2020,Dave P.,"Lived here for 9 years and loved it. The staff, in partiularly the doormen and porters are both professional and helpful, yet with a sense of fun, so it doesnt feel 'stuffy'. The apartments are standard NYC apartments, and as the building is so tall, many of them have amazing views.
Common areas are well maintained and clean, the gym is small but has most things you need, and rarely crowded - they also offer a number of classes, from yoga to cardio burn.
The Rooftop is amazing! 47 stories high, so the views are incredible, and MUCH better than most of the other available rooftop bars in the city. Equipped with sun loungers, as well as tables so a great place to take your dinner in the evening.
Finally location couldnt be more central - A 5 minute walk from the QNRW, 123, BDFM lines, 15 min walk to Grand Central and Trader Joes, 10 to Penn and Times Square, 3 minutes from Bryant Park & Whole Foods etc. Yes, there are a lot of people around, but this is Manhattan - what do you expext?! Also makes for a feeling of safety - both around the building and inside.

I thoroughly recommend!",5,0
4/13/2020,Helen P.,"I travel the world for work and play but it's always a treat to come back home to New York city and living here in Midtown at the Atlas.

The front desk team are very personable, friendly and helpful, which makes this feel less like a rental building.  So far, we are very happy with our choice to move in to the Atlas!",5,0
8/30/2019,Ofer A.,"I was looking for an apartment near my office and walked cold into the Atlas. I met Olivia at the leasing office and she took time to show me around the building and describe the amenities (gym, great roof and even breakfast every morning). I then disappeared for a month, looking for other options. When I came back, Olivia was just as charming and showed me few more apartments. I had a hard date to leave my current place, and the apartment I really liked was in renovation. Olivia pulled strings so that the workers complete the renovation on time. In the days that followed, I came with a tap measure half a dozen times (before I signed a contract) and Olivia took me to the apartment patiently and with a smile. Now that I signed a lease and am ready to move in next week, I hope that the rest of the stuff in the Atlas is just as helpful and charming as Olivia.",5,0
7/15/2019,James E.,"I moved into this build about two months ago and have had an excellent experience so far. My apartment is incredibly quiet, especially given that it's midtown. The entire apartment was renovated prior to moving in, including a fully gutted bathroom and new floor, which was appreciated. The actual floorspace of the apartment is very generous compared to the other apartments I looked at prior to coming here, at comparable cost. The staff on the front desk are also incredibly helpful. The roof is an outrageously nice amenity, and the gym is pretty good considering the price, and usually not very populated. Would recommend this building.",5,0
9/17/2017,Gian Maria M.,"I have lived at The Atlas for 6 years before recently moving due to mi family expanding in size.

The Atlas is not only a beautiful building with beautiful amenities and views. It is most of all a great community to live in.

The team, comprised of handymen, porters and front-desk attendants, is truly the best I've ever witnessed.

They really take the concept of customer service to a higher level, to the extent that we often felt like we were living in a five-start hotel instead of a NYC rental building.

Our experience was so great we now moved to another property from Gotham simply because we feel like we cant bear any other level of service/experience than the one we've been accustomed to.

If you are looking for a great building with great great service, The Atlas is the right place.",5,0
12/8/2016,Jim J.,"My first NYC rental. Staff is very helpful, especially during my move in. The girls in the leasing office and front desk guys made the move in painless for me. Its only minutes walking distance from my office and close to everything I need. Only a couple blocks away from the main subway stations. Good lunch spots around. The rooftop is amazing with views that will impress any guest. Oh and having Bryant Park close to the building is nice when you have tourists visiting.",5,0
8/21/2015,Xiu A.,"My sister recently moved in not so long ago. The building is nice. I helped her move and as far as NYC moves go, this was a breeze. The staff is very nice and helpful. I visit very often as I am transitioning moving to NYC myself and looking for a building. Most buildings dont get back to me when i call or email, but the leasing office here gets back to you very fast. They were really helpful and answered all my questions and always got back to me when i had a question.

My favorite part here is the roof. The roof alone makes this place worth living in. Unlike most buildings, you dont get the loud obnoxious party crowd. The tenants are very respectful and nice.
The location is prime since its close to the train and alot of restaurants. Crossing my fingers that i can move here this winter!",5,0
3/4/2015,Brooke V.,"I moved to NYC for work and lived in the Atlas since it helped with the commute.  I cannot say nicer things about the staff and the building.  I was warmly welcomed by the front desk staff every day (shout out to Tom for always being extremely helpful) as well as Maintenance or whoever was in the building working.  Any maintenance requests were quickly followed up on and the leasing staff did a great job at prompty returning my deposit when I unfortunately had to move to the midwest.  I worked mostly with Liza and she was very attentive and professional.

Long story short, yes it is expensive but it is one of those buildings where you get what you pay for.  If I ever get the opportunity to move back to the City the Atlas is the first place I would look to move to.",5,0
6/12/2014,Mary D.,"Atlas NY is a wonderful place to live, and the leasing experience made it even better.

5/26/2021,Buick M.,"This place is a glorified housing project. It looks great from the surface, but it does not deliver.  There are constantly people smoking cigarettes and marijuana in the hallways and staircases.  There's gum on the walls - someone even peed in an elevator.  My apartment always smells like marijuana - no matter how long I have a candle burning.  Management does absolutely nothing to curb this behavior. In fact, if you call them, they do not answer and if you email them they don't respond. There are people playing loud music at all hours, dogs barking... If I wanted to live in a HUD apartment, I would be paying a lot less.",1,0
3/3/2021,Karla S.,"The building is beautiful and the views are great. My issue with this building and the reason I am moving out is the management team. They really don't do anything to help and tend to complicate things. They never made me feel like they were on ""my side"" and considering the extremely high rents, residents should be treated way better. Whenever I asked what my options were to break my lease he said   ""I don't believe you and the excuses I've read so far. You can stay until your lease expires or pay me a large sum to consider breaking your contract.  You problem, not mine."" It truly sucks to be treated this way, they are very aggressive and only care about money and not the happiness of residents. The gym management team also has very strange rules that end up negatively affecting residents. I would be very careful before deciding to move in because there are very similar luxury buildings in the area.",2,0
12/30/2020,Stephanie G.,"I've been a tenant here for under a year and will not be resigning my lease. While the location is convenient and amenities are nice, I would never recommend to anyone. Even the low rates they seem to be advertising to new tenants, is not worth the hassle of actually living here. Management is the worst I've ever dealt with - extremely hard to get in touch with despite various attempts through multiple channels, and when you can they are impatient and lack respect. They are incredibly unwilling to accommodate, from large issues, like rent rates and tenant concerns, to amenity requests and usage. The rooftop is one of the best I've seen in lower Manhattan, but good luck ever getting to use it. Even on special occasions (NYE, birthdays, etc), management refuses to let tenants use it in the evenings. Why are we paying for amenities that we can't use?

There are plenty of other apartments in the area, offering better rates and above average management. Rockrose in less than desirable and no one deserves that kind of treatment, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.

The one star is for the building staff. I actually have really come to appreciate the doorman, they are all very polite and personable. They are the real heroes of 200 Water.",1,0
5/12/2017,Anne R.,"Avoid it, it is a nightmare!  I would give it no star if I had that choice!  The rooftop is as great as everyone says it is BUT it doesn't make living there worth it. Why? The building overcrowded with many students, which means crowded elevators, gym and loud neighbors. Honestly only 2 elevators out of 4 work. doesn't matter east side or west side..both same. sometimes had to wait 15 mins for elevators. I could hear the neighbors having sex and you can hear the partying throughout the unit when it's down the halls, as well as the sounds slamming doors, yelling,... They are college students and they yell all the time in lobby or hallways. I lived in upper level(floor 20) but still could hear cars on street even when the windows were closed. So, basically the walls are super thin! The gym is busy during rush hours, dry cleaning is expensive. Yeah, it's the worst place I have EVER lived. Hopefully I moved out few months ago. Also, even the doorman are so rude and angry! they are not well trained! they act like college students..This building is very expensive and a big disaster.",1,0
11/5/2013,Fhdjk S.,"Never and I mean NEVER rent a property managed by Rockrose. Not only did they charge an extra month of rent for the month AFTER our lease ended but they refused to rectify the mistake when we accidentally paid it. Additionally, the security deposit takes forever to get back and they are constantly sending rude emails to the entire building about noise, holidays, roof regulations, etc. If you want to feel like you're living with Big Brother watching over you go ahead, otherwise rent somewhere else.",1,0
7/12/2011,David L.,"The location is great, the staff on location are great.  It's the company, Rockrose, that is unbelievably awful.  First, the structure of the building is terrible, as it leaks in our apartment every time it rains.  The maintenance staff has done patchwork every time.  Only to have it leak again.  What else can they do?  They'd have to tear into the actual infrastructure, but Rockrose would rather have our extremely high rent instead of fixing it for good.  That would cost money and make a tenant happy.

Second, they'll offer you a great introductory rate to get you in, then jack up your rent when you try to renew your lease.  Great way to reward loyalty.  This is on top of their building falling under rent control laws, but they're disputing the courts finding because that would mean they can't price gouge anymore.  They got a huge tax break for development, and they want more of your money too.

Third, every morning the elevators and common areas are littered with bottles, cans, and even partially eaten cheeseburgers because many tenants treat the place like a garbage dump.  Not really Rockrose's fault, but they can easily prevent this.  Great rooftop too, but good luck trying to get your guests up there with their extremely strict ""tenants only"" policy, which they implement whenever they feel like it with little warning via extremely rude security guards.

Short story, don't rent there unless Rockrose sells the place to another company that will actually respect you.",1,0
2/8/2011,Anna A.,"Terrible heating system and BAD privacy!

I am currently living in the building and feel lucky that I will move out in weeks. My terrible experience is in this freezing winter. My air conditioning stopped working normally about a month ago when the extremely cold weather started.

I have so far reported at least 8 times. The super kept coming in. But still it hadn't worked normally. I got a cold twice in this whole process and I even warned them that it was required by NY law to provide heat to tenants. But still...

A week ago, after I called so many times and told them if they didn't fix it within 3 days, I might sue them. The air-conditioning finally started working after they did sth. I got my normal life back.

However, the story didn't end there. Today just after I came back home, I found my air-conditioning turned off and appearantly someone had entered my room. And I called to check with the front desk. They said they were not aware of anyone coming in my room.

But after my roomie came back, she told me someone did come in to fix my air-conditioning which had been fixed a week ago already!!! And after he ""fixed"" it, it STOPPED working normally again!!!

This is rediculous! And when I called front desk, the guy didn't want to talk to me and asked me to call main office between 8 AM and 4 PM. What's wrong with them!! We most people need to work full-time!! And many of us are super busy during day-time...

I don't know what I can do. I may catch a cold again...

And my roommate also complained to me the other day, when I was not home, the leasing office people directly let people come in to see our apartment without permission!! What if I left some of my expensive necklace, rings on the table and some confidential information there!!

What is our privacy!",1,0
4/25/2017,Nikki W.,"Lived there a year and didn't run into any major problems. That said, there was a lot of stuff you shouldn't have to put up with for the cost.

Pros
- Some of the friendliest doormen ever
- Unbeatable location. The seaport is fantastic and you can run along the water
- Dog park right by and a pet friendly building. Lots of cute pups
- One of the cheaper buildings with doormen and amenities in the area (maybe manhattan?)
- Close enough to subways
- Easy repairs in your unit happen pretty quickly
- Beautiful views from the roof

Cons
- Management is incredibly rude and difficult to communicate with after you move in
- They say it used to be an NYU dorm. It never stopped.
- The elevators are constantly broken. There are supposed to be 3 but they've never all been working in the past year. You're lucky if 2 are. Gets really slow in rush times.
- Nasty plumbing issues. Brown stuff coming out of the sink, and our kitchen sink backs up into our tub. Heard this happens to other tenants as well. Management doesn't fix it.
- The gym has a single window and crappy AC, and the treadmills are constantly broken

If you're used to crappy apartments or dorms this will be a step up, but it gets old really quickly once you remember what you're paying.",2,0

10/30/2015,Karina M.,"I have lived in this building for approx 6 years.

The building:
I love it. The building management team recently decided to renovate, and although it was a little inconvenient - the building looks brand new again. The walls are a little thin, and I can sometimes hear my neighbors. Thankfully one of my neighbors moved out - she was particularly loud and obnoxious - but thankfully she moved out. This is not unlike any other large dwelling.
I have never lived in another building that is this CLEAN. The hallways get vaccumed, the garbage disposal areas on each floor are cleaned daily. I have not seen one roach - the entire time I've lived here. (SERIOUSLY, NOT ONCE!) THAT IS FANTASTIC.
The building is PET FRIENDLY. So there's plenty of dogs to greet you in elevators.

Gym / Laundry room /Lounge were all renovated recently. And the gym itself is very busy during peak hours, but you can generally find the right time to go.

The roofdeck is phenomenal - the views are amazing.

The staff:
From the building manager, to doormen, to maintenance and cleaning - everyone has been wonderful. They even helped me when I moved apartments (within the building)! I have been there for a while and I know most of the staff personally at this point. They are all super professional and always helpful.
The building staff respond to all requests almost immediately and if possible most are resolved within a day or two.

The rent:
The rent has been steadily going up, but the maximum allowed (4-5% a year) - sadly my salary doesn't grow at the same pace. The rents are rising way too quickly all around the city.

SANDY:
The handling of the Sandy hurricane and its aftermath was fantastic. Yes - I was displaced for the month after, but unlike other buildings in the area - the building management sent daily updates of the ongoing progress. AND the rent was waived for the time the tenants were displaced. They also offered a fridge cleaning service - for free - since many people left in a hurry. Bravo!",5,0

1/14/2017,Ally W.,"We moved to NY to complete my residency at Maimonides Medical Center.  When we first moved to the building, it was heavily under construction.  It was a total eyesore, filled with banging and construction day and night.  Problematic plumbing, non-working heating units; which caused my husband to get very sick and suffer pneumonia our first winter at 66 Rockwell.  There were a host of problems that caused many of the residents to move out. These were all reasons for us to move out as well and not renew our lease when our lease expired. However, we did renew our lease at that time because through all the issues and inconveniences, we felt appreciated and our concerns were heard and addressed empathetically.

As time went by and management changed, there remained only a few friendly faces. Carlene, Megan, and Enis. I learned through the building staff there was a new property manager.  I recently began having issues with my rent payment account and wanted to speak with him/her to address it.  I was given the property manager's email and name, and I sent an email introducing myself and the problem I was having.  I received a response several days later where the property manager's response was ""Carlene will contact you by the end of the day to address your concern"" as well as ""I have an open door policy, please stop by at any time.""  I took up the offer to stop by the office since I was at home that day to meet her. I was pleasantly greeted by Carlene and waited for what I thought would be the property manager come out of her office to meet me. There is music that plays in the office and ironically as the music ended, I heard as clear as the view on a sunny country field, the property manager saying ""I ain't got time for that shit, you figure it out."" I could not believe what I heard.  Is this how the property manager treated the people who live and pay thousands of dollars in the building? Is this the way the property manager speaks to the staff? I only figured since I was home and in the building that I would go into the office to ask about the rent issues. What happened to the open door policy? I was shocked but I am glad I went in unexpectedly.

I left and went directly to the front desk to ask for the boss's contact information. However this information was not available and unknown.  It seems most of the staff in the building are very concerned about getting fired because it the property manager has a record of firing and bullying others.  I would not feel content to know I may cause any staff at Rockwell to be fired so I did not push the issue anymore.  What I did do is not renew my lease.  I will not spend another dollar in a building where the property manager is rude.

The building is beautiful (5 stars). The front desk staff are always professional and has never been a disappointment. Enis, the building cannot survive without you.  Carlene you genuine and have always been understanding and great.  Joshua you need to be a little more understand and not so presumptuous.  Desique, I admire your creativity.

The managers and maintenance staff are very helpful and are always there to assist when needed. I enjoy going to all the events that the building has hosted and loved spending time with my neighbors. I really feel safe at home at Rockwell Place. I would definitely recommend anyone to live in this building and I guarantee you will not regret it :),5,0
12/15/2017,Agnes G.,"I'm a resident at 66 Rockwell for a few years now and I absolutely love it! Staff is always incredibly nice and helpful. Many amenities including gym, sky lounge, dance room, yoga room, arcade, barbecue area outside, zen garden, chef kitchen and party areas. Offers many classes and clubs such as, cooking classes, yoga classes, dance classes, kickboxing classes, book club etc. Sky lounge views are breathtaking and the lounge itself is very cozy. They often organize events and parties/ barbecues for residents including but not limited to, Halloween parties, New Year's Eve, Fourth of July, Saint Patrick's, Memorial Day weekend and free movie screenings. Would totally recommend for a place to live in Brooklyn, New York!",5,0

12/15/2017,Jillian M.,"Although I'm not a resident, yet, 66 Rockwell has to be my favorite luxury building in Brooklyn! I've had the pleasure of attending an event there, as well as a touring the building. The whole Rockwell experience from the wonderfully warm and detail oriented Building Manager Orisha, to the friendly and capable staff, to the gorgeous Zen garden and other remarkable amenities make 66 Rockwell a dream building. Definitely check it out!!",5,0

12/15/2017,James K.,"I've lived here 9 months now and it's definitely the best place I've lived in NYC. I've lived in several places throughout the city, mostly in the East Village and Downtown Brooklyn, and 66 Rockwell is the place I feel most at home. The building is well-maintained and clean, and the location is great. I found this building randomly through a broker, and I'm glad I did.",5,0
12/15/2017,Tinker B.,"Super building to living in. I chose this building because of super location (e.g. almost all subways within 0,5 -3 blocks) and amenities (sky lounge with amazing views, gym, coffee kiosk, game room etc.). The concierge team takes such great care of us. Maintenance is super responsive. All my friend are jealous of me, when they visit the building. Simply love living here.",5,0
12/15/2017,Ashland H.,"I visited all of the high end buildings in Fort Greene and can say that they are all lovely. While there was a lot of trepidation regarding which building to select and call home the people at 66 Rockwell made it a very easy decision. Alex Nunner is awesome, he was very welcoming and accommodating to me and my daughters during our drop in visit. He carefully walked me through the application process and was very flexible regarding the moving pieces within my personal life. What really sold me on the building was his follow up email to me the following day regarding my visit. Chris and all of the staff at the front desk are very welcoming and are very responsive. I am usually not a morning person but am immediately cheered up by their ""Good morning and have a good day"". Enis in maintenance is phenomenal as well, he immediately diagnoses issues and works rapidly to resolve them. He is responsive and patient I.e showing me how to properly open and lock the patio door"". The building is phenomenal from the sky lounge which provides you with breathtaking views and the amenities within the club lounge. All in all the apartment building and community is phenomenal I am so excited that I made this decision",5,0
12/15/2017,Yuri L.,"Rockwell is the place to live with excellent staff and amazing living benefits. The place makes you feel right at home.

I'd highly recommend this building to anyone looking in the area!",5,0
12/10/2017,Adriana N.,"We are well into our second year of living at 66 Rockwell, and (like many others) have only great things to say about this building. My boyfriend started out in a studio here, and a year later, we moved into our 1-bedroom - we are really excited to embrace another year here, where you will never feel alone because it truly feels like home!

First of all, the location is marvellous - blocks away from several trains, so you always have options. All of the stops are a 5 minute walk (or less) depending on where you need to go.

The concierge and maintenance personnel are always available, always helpful, and always kind. If you put in a request or need a hand with anything at all, your issue is often resolved right away, if not, soon after. I can always count on any member of building to give a hand when need be.

The building amenities are always functioning and open for use (the coffee shop on a Sunday is the greatest gift we could ask for!!) not to mention the several events they host throughout the month: movie nights, gym classes, comedy shows, book club, cooking classes... the list can go on and on.

Rent is fair for what you receive back and you will LOVE coming home to your space. Apartment views are beautiful and even studios are incredibly spacious. Highly, highly recommend living at 66 Rockwell :)",5,0
12/10/2017,Charlie A.,66 Rockwell provides everything from upscale amenities to simple necessities such as valet package delivery to your apartment.

Definitely the best place we've lived in NYC. We saw a couple of units in the building before we moved in, and they were all spacious and bright with tons of natural sunlight and had incredible views. Not to mention enough counter space in the kitchen to cook and entertain! Common areas that you actually want to hang out in, a gym that's never crowded, and a skylounge on the roof with a spectacular view of the city. Highly recommend.",5,0

12/8/2017,Makram A.,"I have been living in New York since September 2009. I have lived everywhere in Manhattan from Battery Park, the West Village, and the Upper East Side. After growing tired with the noise and crowds of Manhattan and decided to become a Brooklynite and moved to 66 Rockwell Place in August 2017. Since moving into the building I feel at home. The Doormen are all kind, pleasant, helpful and go out of their way to accommodate you. Enis the building manager is always on top of any request that you make and is quick to respond. The building is luxurious and has large common spaces with friendly neighbors that enjoy interacting as part of a community. Overall I grade it as 5/5. I'm lucky to call it home.",5,0

12/6/2017,Sruthi L.,"Hands down one of the best buildings I've lived in (and I've tried everything from independently owned tiny apartment to other fancy condos). I first came across the building when I visited my boyfriend at the time while he lived there 3 years ago, and I eventually moved in. Throughout, the folks at the concierge have been efficient and courteous without being invasive, and I can say the experience is exactly the same 3 years later. They deal with packages, unexpected visitors, me leaving my straightening iron on (!!) uncomplainingly.
The management team has been responsive the community directors come up with creative ways to bring the people in the building together, and of course, Enis (the building manager) is usually attending to the problem within the hour if anything goes wrong.
All in all, 66 Rockwell makes for easy living, especially with the amazing views of the Statue of Liberty and Manhattan!",5,0

11/30/2017,Amber T.,"I've been very happy with 66 Rockwell since I moved in in February. The building staff are incredibly nice (thank you Chris, Angel, Melanie, & Enis!), and the building is very well maintained.

There is a gym (with a few classes), arcade, poker room, rooftop -- basically everything you could ask for (minus a swimming pool). My main regret is that I don't take advantage of the amenities enough! They even deliver packages directly to your apartment while you are at work.

Overall, I would definitely recommend 66 Rockwell to anyone looking for a great apartment in Downtown Brooklyn.",5,0
11/29/2017,Alex D.,"I've really enjoyed my time in the building since moving here in March. Our apartment is spacious, the views are spectacular, the building is well-kept and luxurious, and the neighbors are wonderfully pleasant!

The front desk concierge is really the cream of the crop: funny, genuine and personable - they always have time to chat if you want to :) I personally appreciate the warm ""hello"" and smile that greets me every morning, evening, and any time in-between (cheers Chris, Angel, Melanie and Daniel!)

Jamel, Marcus, and the other porters - thanks for being friendly, pleasant and always helping out with a smile.

Also thanks to Enis, who makes sure everything at the building is running smoothly (and if it's not, he makes sure to address issues as soon as he's able to). The urgency and attention to detail is appreciated by everyone in the building.",5,0

All of the staff are incredibly nice and accommodating. Alex our rental agent was genuinely interested in making our move in smooth and easy. The approval process wasn't the intrusive and intimidating process we're used to where our financial history and privacy are infringed. It was actually a very delightful process. We liked that the building sources from Brooklyn small businesses, and that its a blend of market rate and affordable units. The resident manager Enis and head concierge Chris, as well as Melanie, Angel, Marcus, Jamel, and one guy whom I'm forgetting his name that works the desk at night -- all really great people willing to help everyone out with any issue. Priya at the coffee window is so pleasant. The concierge dry cleaning people are amazing too. Can't say enough about these folks and the building itself. We highly recommend.",5,0

2/10/2021,Marie S.,Lakewood is the new ghetto by the beach! Tenants banging all hours of the night management puts a letter on everyone door. Cars are being broken into and tenants are being harassed. Management does nothing and the unfriendly staff in the leasing office does nothing to help the situation. Do not move here if you can find something better! Good news Lakewood accepts Section 8 now and you see druggies hanging in the hallways and garage all day long.,1,0
12/12/2020,Richard C.,"This place is a joke!  I was grateful to live here less than a year!  Very , Very noisy if it's not your neighbors keeping you up it, it's the garbage collectors.  O yeah and let's not forget you have San Francisco police department shooting range across the street firing their guns all day and night!  Not safe while living there was woken up by a guy busting a guy breaking into his car, having a altercation with him and then chasing him.  Management is rude and unprofessional .  When moving out shampooed my carpet twice and they still charged me $100.00 and when I questioned it they were rude about it and still charged me.  I'm just glad to be out of there and don't want to think of this nightmare anymore.  I just wanted to warn people so they don't go through what I did.  Don't do it!",1,0

11/1/2015,Mark A.,"This place is total crap hole. The halls wreak of mildew, the carpet needed to be replaced like 15 years ago, there is often garbage in the garage which is always fun when you walk out the door and are greeted by a hissing raccoon which the management also denies/ignores as a problem. If you ever have anything delivered here you have a 50/50 of either getting it or having it stolen. The layout of the apartments is very odd, you can literally walk down a hall and the apartments are label something like 405, 406, 410, 408, 415, etc...it makes no sense. Also, there's a $22 million project across the street to clean up 80 years' worth of shotgun pellets and busted clay pigeons that litter the lakeside skeet- and trap-shooting range. I look forward to my cancer diagnosis in 20 years. You're better off finding something in the Sunset or Daly City.",1,0
9/13/2012,Julia M.,"I had such high expectations when I moved in. The staff was incredibly nice when I was signing my lease. Then came day two. They switched on a dime. I feel so betrayed. It has been a a month. I have had a horrible altercation in the office with the manager Haley Gonzabos. She needs to take a management seminar and learn how to catch some flies with honey. The employees don't even look up when you walk in. They only talk to ""prospective"" tenants, not the existing tenants. I am out of here in 11 months. I feel like I am in prison, counting down the days.",1,0
9/13/2012,Lynn M.,"I am so mad right now. I took time off from work to go pick up my package on my lunch break. The packages are delivered to the management office. They only let you  pick them up between 8-9am and 5-6pm, that's it, no exceptions. I work. 2 jobs. 7 days a week. Yes, I work very hard. Times are tough. I walk in to get my package after they left a message on my phone to come pick it up. They refuse. The manager is there, Haley. I explain to her the situation, she says, ""If I break the rules for you, I have to break the rules for everyone"". I have contacted the San Francisco rent board and they are very interested in what is going on. The office staff is just so confrontational every time I walk in. This place is pathetic!!!",1,0

I wish I had talked to the residents before I moved in. I have been here 3 months and am looking to break my lease. I hope people read this board.",1,0
11/3/2008,Nikki F.,"The residents are rude. Their was often a baby crying and someone shouted ""Shut your F*cking kid up!"" People don't hold the elevators for you, so rude. In addition, my car was just stolen from my own parking space in the apartment parking garage. Poor security if you ask me.

The snack vending machine has been broken for more than a month now and it ate my roommate's money. The coke is always sold out in the vending machine on my floor, so I always have to walk to the rec center to get a coke.",1,0
7/20/2014,K H.,"First, the people in the office are friendly.
The location is not the best. It sits in a gully of cold and fog. You need a vehicle for sure. The noise level is bad. All day & night you hear the constant guns going off from the police range. They shoot well past 11pm at times. The highway with constant cars & trucks that you need to keep the windows closed to hear the tv.
The apartment is always cold like an air conditioner was on super cold. The cost to use their baseboard heat is super expensive - over a $380 electric bill.  The dampness in the apartment is very bad as well. Water drops from the ceiling that you need to run a large dehumidifier running all the time. Your towels will always be damp no matter what. Your clothes and leather jackets will get white mildew spots on them.
Having to share a water meter with other apartments is nuts.
There are quite a few renters who  have no regard for others. They yell, scream & have parties well past 2am.
The garage has large raccoons that are in the garbage bin and during the day too. This makes it dangerous walking to your car not knowing if a rabid raccoon will attack you, or you can het bit while throwing trash away.
The maintenance people at times do not fix the problems.
The cost to rent here is not worth it.",2,0
8/16/2010,Ale S.,"We moved here when I was pregnant, so we thought it would be a nice place to raise a family, but we were so wrong. It's nothing but the pool that's suitable for a kid. THe weather is always horrible (crying for sun and warmth) even as compared to dtown SF. Hate the carpets, no playground within a walking distance (the one that belongs to the company is designed for some 10-12 years-old kids, always empty, dirty and dark). You can't avoid the shooting sounds coming from across the street. And yes a CAR is a must-have.",2,0
1/2/2010,Dirk C.,"What you see is what you get at Lakewood.  It's a very old building next to a shooting range.  I've lived in a lot of apartments and this one really isn't that bad.  The rent is cheap and the owner does not give rent increases to tenants who have been here the longest; some have been paying the same amount for the past 10-30 years.
Someone else mentioned asbestos.  Most apartments do have asbestos.  I moved to Lakewood from a brand new luxury apartment that had tons.  It's not really avoidable, so try not to be put off by that.  
As for size, the apartments range from very small to very large.  Almost every unit is completely different from one building to the next.  My one-bedroom is roughly 800sq feet, but I almost got stuck in one that was much smaller.  Wish I could've gotten the bigger one : )
I agree that the recent elevator problems suck, but that's the same for most apt. buildings.  I also agree that the laundry rooms were pretty awful, but  have recently been updated.   And some rooms are just nicer/cleaner than others.
I like being within walking distance to the beach and that the mall/grocery store is nearby.  I also like the fact the the gym has an actual locker room and there's an on-site dry cleaning business.   Management gets on my nerves sometimes, but they are much more flexible/helpful than most other property managers.
My biggest complaint about Lakewood is the narrow parking garage spaces.  After I get into my stall, I can't even open my passenger side door and if my neighbor parks too far over, it's hard to get out of the driver's side.  The shooting range kinda sucks, but if you work during the daytime, you won't notice much.  At night it's pretty quiet around here due to seclusion between the golf courses.  My unit is insanely quiet.  I almost never hear my neighbors, but I've heard that some units are very noisy and it probably depends on which building you live in.  They were all built at different times and some might be more soundproof than others.",4,0

After an unfortunate break in of our car while we were across country from home - we lost many things of monetary and more importantly personal value.

10/9/2018,Jackson R.,"The Apartment itself is very nice, the upkeep is great and has an awesome pet wash! However the staffing could be improved. There are some conversations that I over heard between management that residents paying a pretty penny to live here should be subjected to hearing. I had a conversation with a young woman a couple weeks ago, Lena I want to say her name is, and she comes off very intitled and snobbish. I will not be addressing her in the future and I suggest you dont either. Also a gentleman by the name of Mark was just thee rudest, I attempted to talk about issue I was having and he must have interupted me 5 times and I was unable to get a word in. I gave up and walked away. Other then these 2 people my stay thus far has been well. I appreciate the roof top and dog wash.

4/28/2018,Ashton J.,"The apartment community was great at first and as more tenants started moving in, it went from great to crap in a matter of months. A lot of 20-somethings in the building (who most likely share a 2 or 3-bedroom with 3 or 4 others) have no regard for other tenants and are often loud/obnoxious. The building has a strict ""no smoking"" policy (and this is clearly stated in the lease agreement) but we've seen people smoking (including marijuana) on the rooftop deck and on their patios on 1st floor. And the building staff/management have done nothing about it. On one particular occasion, some tenants smoked marijuana in an apartment, and a few folks got in to a heated argument which was reported by a neighbor and needless to say the cops showed up to address the situation. The entire floor was filled with smoke and smelled of marijuana! Some tenants basically treat the common space, especially the lounge on the second floor, as their living room. They hog the common space/amenities and basically hang out all day and all evening in the lounge preventing other tenants from being able to use this space.",2,0

2/8/2021,Eric V.,"Horrible experience and would encourage you to avoid this company. Leasing agent Koren Alexander is a racist and classism! She treated me like garbage and dismissed me entirely. Why treat a potential resident like this? As of today she has made ZERO attempt to reconnect with me and answer my questions, even though she said ""I will get back to you"". It's been four days. You read reviews from tenants in which they outline how horrible this company is and while you hope those are isolated issues and give them a chance, only to be subjected to people like Koren Alexander. People like her, fuel the negative image for your company. I was told that many people have great experience with her. Perhaps, but imagine the countless other people she treated this way. This story serves as a beacon for those individuals who are faceless victim of her racism and classism. I hope management comes to the conclusion that one report of racism is one too many.

9/21/2018,Lola P.,"RentSFNow posts questionable listings on Craigslist and urges you to give them your credit card number without viewing their apartments first. When you enquire about specific things they stop answering your e-mails. Do these places even exist?!

It reminds me of a Nigerian scam where they want you to wire money to Lagos.

The number one rule on Craigslist: DO NOT RENT SIGHT UNSEEN.

I strongly advise you report shady posts to make Craigslist a safer space for renters.",1,0

Updated review",Jessica P.,"If you do make the terrible mistake of renting from them and inevitably run into an issue, call the main Greentree number and ask for Joy. (And when the receptionist says she's unavailable, say you'll wait on the line until she's free. She'll magically be available!). Joy removed the $800 charge shortly after getting involved in this issue (which overall took 2 weeks, daily phone calls, countless emails, and multiple reminders of my knowledge of the charge's violation of the California Civil Code to resolve).

Oh also -- forgot to mention that their ""renovations"" are only cosmetic. Yes, you'll be able to do laundry in your unit, but do you really want to hear your neighbors have normal volume conversations, sneeze, listen to classical music while working from home, or let's say...get to know each other better ;-) because Greentree is too cheap to insulate the walls? Here's hoping you don't also rent below someone whose dog wakes up at 5am daily!",1,0
7/24/2018,Paige P.,"Terrible customer service. Unprofessional.

I have never been annoyed with a company. We rented in Jan-May of 2017 on a month to month lease. Never heard a word from ANYONE until now, a year and a half later. I got a call from a collections service this morning saying we owed $2,600 and we were on our final notice before it effects our credit.

No phone calls, no letter, no emails- NOTHING on their end to let us know about this charge.

I have been trying to talk to someone all morning to find out why we were not notified for a YEAR AND A HALF, but I've been getting the run around. ""They will call you back"" ""we'll have an answer for you"" ""accounting department doesn't have a phone number""

To be clear, I am not complaining about owing money, it's their lack of communication and incompetence that has led me to write this review. We could have paid this off a year ago, instead I'm dealing with a collections agency.",1,0
3/5/2018,David R.,"I won't go into detail, but this is one of the worst property management companies in San Francisco. Them and companies alike are the exact reason gentrification is a systemic issue in the bay area.

Passing all fees to tenants and imposing inexcusable rent hikes. They will work their hardest to get every SINGLE dime they can out of you.

Edit: Some advice to RentSFNow, stop paying Yelp to have such a high rating. Your unwarranted ad spending is trickling down to your tenants.

4/23/2017,Alex F.,"We very recently found an apartment with RentSFNow and found the process to be straightforward and largely stress-free. After making a short list of properties, we arranged a number of viewings and then made an application in the afternoon. A few days later the lease was signed by all parties. Overall this was very quick and easy. We did however have a few difficulties with the website, and had a technical error during the application process which took a few hours to resolve - causing some stress. For RentSFNow we'd give: 4/5

Mike Simpson was our letting agent and we strongly recommend him. He was professional yet laid-back, making for a good atmosphere for viewings. He was very attentive and responsive when we had questions regarding the  signing of the lease. Finally we feel he was very genuine and honest when answering our questions, giving us all the information we needed to find a place that worked well for us. Highly recommended! Rating for Mike Simpson: 5/5.

p.s. It would be great if it was possible to put international phone numbers on the online application form (it seemed to only accept US numbers). For other people moving from abroad this would be very helpful.",4,0

Our apartment was a new build out for this company, so everything was brand new upon our arrival. This is good and bad.. good because it was very clean and nicely decorated, bad because there were many technical /maintenance issues during our month long stay. However, these things happen, and Caitlin was very diligent to make sure that every need was addressed. She and Nasim both took care of us, even reaching out to see if our stay was going well without prompt, and personally attending every maintenance call that was needed until the job was complete.

8/10/2020,Rebecca S.,"I have enjoyed renting from RentSFNow.  I am most grateful for Lauren, the Resident Manager for 835 Pine. She is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met.  

I distinctly remember when I got the keys to my new place.  When I went inside, it felt abnormally warm.  Being that my unit was on top of the boiler room, it would always be warmer than other unit. I had a mini panic attack and she so calmly and patiently listened and helped me through that.

In addition to her being very responsive, organized, and resourceful, she has gone out of her way to support me. For example, I have been away from my apartment for an extended period of time and she has so kindly placed my mail and packages in my apartment.  She works outside hours to tend to emergency situations.  For instance, I had a leak in my sink pipe and upon reaching out, I heard back from her within 5 minutes and the technician came within 20 minutes.  We also had a plumbing/water problem in the building and she sent out an email in the evening notifying us about the water shut-off.

She is so hard-working, helpful, and dedicated to my happiness.  I want the best for her and recommend her for advancement in any position she aspires to be.  You can't teach kindness, empathy or warmth.  She already has that and she stands out.  I REALLY like her!",5,0

4/19/2019,Mj Q.,"First experience with RentSFNow. I was taking the shotgun approach on craigslist when I stumbled on a listing for a property being shown by Nolan Justus. Nolan showed me around that original place, then recommended another after asking more detailed questions about what I was after. That second property ended up being ideal; he was prompt in sending the application, guiding me through the process, and getting all involved parties to complete their steps as soon as possible. Within 48 hours we went from showing to approval to executed lease. When one considers how many other people and leads he's got to follow up on, that's impressive.

A few examples:  Dan met me on my arrival day in front of the building where he was holding a parking spot for me (in Hayes Valley there's NO place to park), making my move easy and fast.  Koren was my main point of contact, she always got back to me straight away, either answering questions or having someone on her team contact me to address any concerns I had.  I stayed at the apt for 5 months, a short-term furnished lease.  

It was a great choice of a place to stay, in a central area with my own laundry, all I had to bring were my clothes.  Rent included all utilities which made it very easy.

8/23/2016,Xavier D.,"This review is specifically regarding agent Dean Smith. As a Florida resident, I accepted a position in the SF area which will keep me in SF for about 3 years. Before arriving to SF, I started searching for apartments and was surprised at how many fraud listings there were on other apartment sites. Until I ran across RentSF Now, the agents were pleasant to speak with and followed up with me on several listings. The agent at RentSF Now took all of my information and stated a Real Estate agent would call me back, and of course Dean Smith called me back. He was pleasant to speak with and informed me of the process and made arrangements for me to see several of the apartments I was interested in. Upon arriving in SF the following week, I met with Dean at the first location and he was pleasant, cordial and inviting. He took the time to show me the benefits and features of the apartment and never was insistent on closing a sale. On each and every apartment I saw that day, he performed marvelously and went out of his way to answer many questions I had. However, at the end of the appointment time/day, I was still not convinced on the units I saw. After discussing my reservations and my requirements, Dean told me he had two other apartments in mind that would probably fit my needs. He drove me across town and showed me a unit in the Castro and a unit close to Nob Hill, and BINGO the unit close to Nob Hill was the one.
It is the dedication of such agents like Dean Smith that makes a difference for any institution. Please extend a thank you to Dean Smith and pass along my KUDOS to him, Dean Smith is a stellar and experienced agent and I am glad to have met him.",5,0

Mari went out of her way to help me find the perfect place for me  and my husband.  She showed me an apartment and it was what I wanted but there was already a contract on it from another leasing agent.  Mari then found me the apartment I am in now and showed it to me the next morning at 9:00am. We were moved in within four days.  It was so expedient I would recommend her to anyone, anytime and with the utmost assurance that she will take care of them.

She processed my application the day I put it in and I took deposits to the main office and hours later we were approved.  She spent hours and hours answering my questions via text messaging and was prompt to answer each and every time.  She even took the time to listen to my life's moments and helped me get situated without batting an eye.  I actually got the keys the next day.  I did a walk through with management and we moved the next day.

David took tons of pictures and emailed them to me; I loved the apartment  and made my boyfriend go see it that night  to make sure everything was legit. Once my bf said it was great, I sent David all my documents via email and signed the lease. I am super excited when I go back to SF this week that I will have a new home!

Though I haven't met David in person yet, he is very pleasant to speak to and more importantly he is quick via emails, texts and phone. I would definitely use the company again.",5,0

Lisa has gone above and beyond to keep me informed, stay in constant communication with me and show me apartments that she thought best suited me and my dogs needs.  I am so excited to be moving to SF and even more excited to have found the perfect apartment.  Forget Craigslist, call someone from RentSFNow and they will help find you the perfect apartment.",5,0

I called this company because of a Craiglist add I looked at.  I got in contact with Lisa who told me when her open houses were.  The first two apartments didn't work out, but I was able to stop looking at Craiglist because Lisa referred me to 4 other apartment listings she had!  I am now finally all moved into my new apartment in San Francisco and couldn't have been happier!

7/14/2017,Tina N.,"The Duboce is a beautiful place with a magnificent view and a great location. I am in a 1B and it is spacious, has all the amenities I need and plenty of daylight (which I really love!). The staff is friendly and always helpful and especially the Manager, Tyler, is great. The rooftop terrace has one of the best views in the city.

I did experience a few initial challenges with my leasing agreement; first, the actual agreement got stuck in the system somewhere so I couldn't sign it, and for my initial deposit, I was told two different amounts by two different leasing agents. When I asked for a receipt for the amount (as my employer would be issuing the check), I was given a screen shot and told that was all, I could get. That was quite difficult to get approved with my boss.",4,0
6/5/2019,Nicole N.,"I came last Wednesday to visit my friend and was blown away by how beautiful the apartments are. I happened to come while they were doing an appreciation night and I was really amazed that the apartment management was doing something like that. They had lots of food, drinks, a raffle and even a Dj. I was introduced to the manager Brittany and she was so welcoming even to me as a guest.  She was very involved with all the residents and engaged with everyone in such friendly manor. In the two years my friend has lived there they've never had many events so it was nice to have two in the same month. I really like the sense of community the management team is trying to build and how involved they are with the residents. It makes a difference when I visit. I definitely look forward to visiting again !

7/7/2017,Jon R.,"From the neighborhood to the staff this apartment building has passes all of my expectations. My apartment is brand new and everything is top of the line. Gas range stove, huge washer and dryer, and luxury finishes like thick baseboards and door trim. The builders really paid attention to detail here and it goes to show. All of that said, the staff is really what made the leasing process so easy for me. The girls in the office are so sweet and are always available if I have any questions. They made leasing super simple, and everything was online and easy to work with. I would have to say the best part is the roof. The fire pit and barbecues are perfect for entertaining my friends and there's even cornhole and a hot tub for the residents. Like I said before this community was very well done and I'm beyond happy to be a part of it. Thank you, Duboce team!",5,0

The roof top has an amazing view of the city and there are great amenities throughout the building.
I moved here very recently from the UK and so the process of leasing was new and very different but the leasing professionals were brilliant. They explained everything I needed to do and documents I needed to obtain and were super helpful. The online concierge and residents portal also made the process accessible and easy to set up insurance and utilities too. Mahary , Sunday and Tyler have been really welcoming and made the move here stress free.

I can't remember another time when the follow-up at an apartment complex was so professional and timely.  The property itself is nice and the parking situation is great as I am able to charge my electric vehicle at the property.  I would also add that from the beginning of the process when I was trying to decide which apartment to select the leasing agent (Sunday) did a great job of helping us select the right apartment for our needs.  And when we moved in we were accommodated with flexibility in elevator schedules and a range of support services that we were not expecting.

I recommend The Duboce for location, physical property, and onsite services.",5,0

4/1/2014,Betty O.,"I said that I would come back and update my review if Park-West Essex listened to my concerns. So the buildings are cleaner now, but unfortunately, I have a new negative feedback due to a problem that the management office has acknowledged is becoming a common complaint from multiple tenants: secondhand smoke.

The management office (Joseph and Shaniqe) ALLOWS smoking inside the apartments. So if your neighbor smokes, your whole apartment will be full of secondhand smoke. The management office keeps telling tenants who complain that there is a law in California that doesn't let them forbid smoking in the units. They say that they can forbid smoking in common areas only, however, that isn't the case either, since their own employee (Mike) smokes in the property. So to make the long story short: they do NOTHING about secondhand smoke coming into your apartment. These are old buildings, so even my remodeled apartment gets the secondhand smoke from my neighbors, along with their noise (no sound proof either; I could write pages about this too). I understand there is a law, but I also know that according to the San Francisco Apartment Association they can do a lot more than ignoring the complaints (especially since they are many): ""The San Francisco Rent Ordinance provides that a landlord may terminate a tenancy where ""[t]he tenant is committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in, or is causing substantial damage to, the rental unit, or is creating a substantial interference with the comfort, safety or enjoyment of the landlord or other tenants in the building, and the nature of such nuisance, damage or interference is specifically stated by the landlord in the writing as required by Section 37.9(c) (sfaa.org/january2013/130…).""  Also, it is their responsibility to inform the smokers that they must avoid secondhand smoke coming into my apartment: ""While smoking may be legal within the unit, it is the tenant's responsibility to prevent the migration of smoke from the unit to the common areas and other units. In letters to smoking tenants, you could suggest quitting or, alternatively, going outside to the street to engage in their habit (sfaa.org/january2013/130…)"". What about preventing smoking through the lease (nonsmoking addendum)? Forget it, they have no initiative at all. The comfort of their tenants is at the bottom of their list.

You might be asking yourself, so why is this person living there? Because I'm waiting for my lease to finish. I'm not planing to pay the one-month of rent early termination fee.

But since this location is really good, I'm putting 3 stars instead of 2 stars.",3,0
4/7/2012,Julianne F.,"I lived here during my last year at USF, and I really appreciate the friendliness of Martine and Katie, the landlord and managers. The grounds were well kept and the ammenities were great - especially as far as SF apartments go. The laundry rooms convenient and rarely overcrowded, the pool downstairs is something you never find elsewhere, the dog walk was regularly cleaned, the elevators are SO convenient and the maintenance team is quick to respond to any apartment issues. I also really appreciated their pet policy as they are less strict about breeds, but more strict about individual personalities of the animals. It's also right next to the 71 bus and a few blocks from the N-Judah, 28 and 29 buses. The location is right next to the main drag of Inner Sunset too, so a five minute walk can take you right to good bars and food :)

A few downsides are that, when apartments are being updated, sometimes you can get last-minute notice that maintenance or renovation teams will be working above you or possibly through your apartment. Also, if there are notices for water shut-off, they're placed downstairs in the mail area/lobby for our building, they're not always accurate or present - but I don't know how much of that is Park West's fault. Also, the prices are pretty high, but again, it's SF, so they're definitely not as high as most other apartment complexes.

Overall, I enjoyed living here and I recommend others to look into Park West.",4,0

6/23/2021,Taste E.,"Beware of living in this community.

- You will live next to the highway - noisy, pollutant, etc

- The building makes a ton of noize between the hours of 4am - 6am moving multiple garbage dumpsters in and out of their garage multiple times a week. the noize woke us up every morning during the week

- they contract with a landscaping service that uses gas powered leaf blowers and mowers. the noise and carbon monoxide pollution are unbearable. Every Wednesday they are polluting the grounds right next to a children's playground. And their concierge on duty every Wednesday would not even speak to us about requesting that the landscaping service use more eco friendly equipment around small children. Think about that, they pay a service to pollute and make noize and dont care about their residents or their children.

- and the people who work the front desk are incredibly rude and unhelpful

For the money there are far better buildings in the area to consider.

Look at the message ""Jake F"" sent me, who claims I am a fake account, but if you perform a google search on his picture, you can tell it is his account and photo that is not real!!! As for, walking downstairs and speaking to someone, if Jake F was a real person or lived here, he would know that apt staff works 9-6 and only sec guards are downstairs after that, who do not know what is going on. Those of us who work during the day for a living cannot walk downstairs and talk to someone.

Shockingly bad neighbors and management.

Apparently one of our neighbors was so drunk they left their sink on for hours or days, which caused water filled with food to leak all over their unit.  And the apartment was so shoddily built, the water is leaking through 6 floors to affect units all over the complex, not only theirs.

One of my neighbors said there's a very real possibility many many units will become infested with mold as a result.

Guess what. There have been NO updates or notice from management about all this. They just want our water damaged and mold growing units to continue and force us to leave so they can raise prices.",1,0

The staff are very friendly and helpful and the apartment was in perfect condition when we moved in. It was cleaned, painted, and restored top to bottom. The appliances were spotless. Everything felt brand new. From the time we first touched base with Venessa for move in, to move out day with Allison, my family have only great things to say about my son's stay.

9/22/2017,Tony M.,"I moved into Rincon Greeen via a relocation and during the 1st 4 months my lodging was provided via my companies relocation policy. The RC community is great - clean, conveniently located within the SOMA/South Beach area and has all the amenities imaginable (great staff, concierge package service, onsite fitness center, awesome rooftop deck, garaged parking for guests!!!!, etc.). When my corporate place expired and the time came for me to move, I did move but loved the RC community so much that I stayed and moved downstairs to a different unit within the same complex. The staff is so welcoming and helpful and being new to the city safety was important for me and especially my family and there was never a time where we didn't feel completely safe and part of a broader community.

I could not recommend Rincon Green more highly. The front desk attendants are Always pleasant and very helpful and the leasing office managers (Allison and Janae in particular) are simply delightful. They regularly accommodated my requests to let vendors into my unit for furtniture deliveries, utility installs, etc. They even helped me sign up for a free year of high speed internet service through one of the providers the building has partnered with! They've always been responsive, informative and tuned in to the needs of the residents. The RC resident portal also offers very convenient ways to manage your account, communicate with other residents and just learn about the area.

I could not have asked for a better community to live in. It really eased my transition to SF and put my mind at ease overall.

Some Pros:
- We worked in SoMa and FiDi, so the location was great for our purposes. The Bart and Transbay Terminal are nearby, which made getting around the city without a car very easy.
- The staff is very professional and efficient. Whenever we needed service in the apartment, it was easy to put in a work order, and they would have it taken care of by the next business day. They are quick to answer any questions and are generally available.
- Great amenities from the gym to the free coffee/tea and package concierge.
- No noise problems in the apartment we were staying in (the west side of the complex).

Minor Con:
- The premium rent is a bit of a con but somewhat expected for the location and type of apartment building. It is comparable to similar buildings.",5,0
6/22/2016,Sneha M.,"The property is great and I highly recommend this to future tenants. Me and my husband lived here for 6 months and would continue staying if we did not have to leave the city!

Allison, Venessa and the management/staff is extremely friendly with all the queries and have been very kind and helpful with anything needed.

The location of property is excellent, walking distance to bart, muni stop or ferry building is about 15 mins walk, cal-train -20 mins walk.

The highlights of property are the hot tub at rooftop with amazing view of bay bridge and 24 hours onsite gym facility.

Despite of the studio we never felt it any small in size or even uncomfortable. The appliances (dishwasher, washer, dryer, microwave) were all good as new. If there was any service issue it was always resolved within a day.

6/12/2016,Robert M.,"My wife and I lived in this building for 2 years (2014-2016) before moving away and enjoyed our experience of living here.

Some of the things we particularly appreciated:
1. Location allowed us both to walk to work in SOMA and to the Ferry Building farmer's market on weekends. A Philz also opened up a block away to cover our coffee fix.
2. Staff was friendly and helpful with random questions, receiving packages etc. The few times we needed service work on our unit (light burned out) etc, they took care of things efficiently.
3. The on-site gym, while lacking a bit of the shiny new feeling, was really handy.

Some things to be aware of that were less appreciated:
1. Relatively speaking, you'll be paying a premium rent for the space.
2. We lived in two different units; our second unit, which was on the outer perimeter in back, could occasionally get noisy in the bedroom from bay bridge traffic. Definitely recommend living facing in the courtyard if possible.
3. Since the building is near several freeway ramps, traffic around rush hour can get crazy if you need to drive/uber/lyft around that time.

For us, the benefits totally outweighed the downsides.",5,0
6/5/2016,Giancarlo D.,"I have lived here for the past year and love Rincon Green. It may not be as flashy as the new developments in Rincon Hill that are popping up every week, but Venessa, Cameron, Joe and the rest of the staff really make up for it by providing incredible service to residents.

Rent is reasonable (by SF standards), emails are answered quickly (sometimes within minutes), service requests are completed promptly, and the property is very well managed. Units have new appliances, large windows, and ethernet ports in most rooms. The gym is huge, and is as nice as they come in this neighborhood. The rooftop is landscaped with succulents and has more than enough seating for you and your friends.

The only downsides are no fault of the staff or building. The San Francisco Bay Bridge is within 50 feet of the building, which means that noise and air pollution on this property are probably higher than in most other parts of the city. For this reason, it's hard to enjoy Emerald Park or the rooftop during times of heavy traffic (mornings and early evenings). That said, the apartments themselves are incredibly quiet and air circulation within the units is more than adequate on even the warmest days in this part of the city.

The biggest plus for me is Emerald Fund. Venessa and the management team are great to work with and I would definitely recommend this building to anyone looking for a convenient SF apartment.",5,0

8/13/2015,Alexx D.,"I lived at Rincon Green for 1 year & enjoyed every single minute! I initially moved there because it was close to work, but after getting to know the city, I would have still lived there no matter where I worked. I recently moved, but only because I relocated to another city.

Rincon Green is like a beautiful sanctuary in the city with calm, serene green space & amazing amenities, including free yoga classes, balcony apartments, rooftop grills & a hot tub. The building is safe & always kept in immaculate condition from the lobby to the parking garage, rooftop entertainment area & fitness rooms.

The staff at Rincon Green all seem to love their jobs. They are extremely pleasant, courteous, helpful & genuinely interested in how you are doing. I've lived in 5 different states, and the management, leasing & maintenance staff are the best of any place I've lived. Everyone is top-notch, especially Sarah, Vennessa and Jairell (whom I truly appreciate for being kind enough to help carry my very heavy sofa when I was moving out).

Rincon Green is conveniently located near restaurants, food stores, shopping in Union Square, AT&T Park, BART, & so much more. It has a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge from the front gate, and it's perfect if you like to go for a walk, run or bike ride along the Embarcadero.

My actual apartment unit was wonderful, too. It was always quiet, and I loved my dishwasher, washing machine & dryer, quartz countertops and plenty of closet space. Plus, the leasing process was super simple. It was so quick and easy, I became a resident just 1 day after moving to the city with no leads on where I should live.

5/29/2020,Tori L.,"After talking with neighbors and my personal experience, I am very upset at how UDR and 399 handled things during the whole covid pandemic. Not only are they not working with people who are trying to renew (increasing rent by over ten percent!) or need a few months extra on their lease (without paying a thousand or more extra a month), the building is barely kept clean, an elevator has been unavailable for over a week, and all the amenities are shut down without any compensation. This building and company is heartless.",1,0
5/18/2020,Jim S.,They try to rip you off on renewals and pretty much ignore you when you try to contact them for help. Do not live here if you want to stay longer than a year because your rent will be going up a lot if you try to renew. You also get nickel and dimed for everything like package management. Right now all their amenities are shut off and several residents have reached out for rent reductions because the amenities were supposed to be a big deal but they just ignore you.,1,0

11/14/2018,Greg M.,"I want to issue a warning to any future residents who are thinking about living here. While 399 is a dog friendly community, the apartments are not built to withstand normal wear and tear caused by any size dog. The laminate floors dent and scratch very easily and UDR engages in practices that are designed to maximize move out expenses. Example - the ""eggshell"" paint is custom mixed for every apartment. As such, any small holes or touch up will require the entire wall to be painted - a single nail will require the entire wall. They will not provide touch up paint so if you plan to hang pictures, do not use nails. The bigger issue is the flooring. If you have slight scratches or marks on even a handful of planks, they will use this as cause to replace the laminate floors in the entire apartment. I'm posting this review to try to make people aware that as soon as you move out, UDR will do anything they can to take their pound of flesh. I would advise finding any other place to live, especially if you have a dog.",1,0

Updated review",Jason B.,"Sadly, I had to update my review as the living experience here severely declined to the point of me looking to move out due to non-stop smoking issues. The building has been notoriously slow to respond about smoking and they do not seem to take the issue seriously at all. To top it off, the response from UDR (property manager) that I would still have to put in a 30-day notice to leave the building is absurd at best, especially considering I'm a long time resident and have been sending in complaints about the smoking for a year. I've gotten to the point of sending in a complaint nearly every single day and the building does nothing to try to resolve. They barely follow up on any contact, calling the front desk results in ""thanks, we'll let management know"", and sending in service ticket just results in them being closed without a response.

If you have any issues with smoking, avoid this building as you will find it near impossible to get a resolution.",1,0
4/19/2016,Matt D.,"Don't trust the fake 5 star reviews posted by management.
This is a UDR property (note that they try to hide that in the name of this listing).
If you want to know about UDR, just read the yelp reviews of any of their other properties.
The building has been on the market for 6+ months but is still completely empty, which clearly speaks volumes, specially in a bustling SF housing market.

The management in this building is rude, racist and will outright lie to your face. Note: if you are Asian or Black you will not be offered any of the deals they have and will be given a higher price. Seems they have hired a bunch of ex-used car salesmen who just provide you with false information.

Avoid at all costs.",2,0
"6/11/2021
Updated review",Kristen K.,"UPDATE: my review went from 5-stars to 3-star.

The front desk is always kind, but service/maintenance and the management staff claim they will help but nothing has been resolved.

Here's why: I transferred to another unit during COVID and paid all the expensive fees to transfer. I even paid for a cleaning service to clean out my old place without any hassle. I was charged a huge fee afterwards to replace the flooring and for the walls. The walls should always be painted for every new resident, hanging picture is apart or normal wear and tear. Same thing goes for the floor. I kept the floor in good condition, I believe they just charged me an additional $500 for the floor to cover the cost of having a new better hardwood floor installed, which is a sneaky tactic. This was during COVID, so they must have been desperate for money to cover this, which they shouldn't be, my rent was $4,000 for a studio.

Now moving onto the unsatisfactory reasons of the new unit I moved into. For one dryer is very loud. It squeaks every time I use it. My dishwasher has an error code on it after EVERY single use. My neighbors smell potent. One neighbor smokes cigarettes and marijuana, it's so strong that it irritates my sinuses and allergies. Another or may be the same or both cook very strong smelling food with spices. I get the two-to-three smells flowing into my apartment from the vents and it's very unsettling.

Not to mention when I moved in here, my washer and dryer were filthy. Especially my washer. I requested for a new washer and dryer but haven't gotten it yet. I have alerted management a handful of times, and nothing.

The service doesn't communicate with you about when they will arrive. In the service requests I say call or text me before hand - they never done, they came once when I requested for them to fix the dryer but it was at a bad time so I told them to come back. They said they would come back that day at 3:30pm. They never showed up, this or similar events actually have happened more than once with service. They seem to really be slacking off. So I'm unhappy with that.

I can't seem to get any help with my issues and it's disturbing. This place is not luxury. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I like my view, the safety and the amenities.",3,0

3/8/2020,Lisa M.,"This is an amazing building. I am a brand-new resident and I would like the world to know about two very exceptional leasing agents who have made my experience first-rate.

I first met with Jessica for my tour instructions. She was very friendly, so personable, and really took the time to explain every single feature I would be viewing. During my self-guided tour, I thought the door of an empty unit was locked. So I texted Jessica and she came up to the floor right away. That's right - here you can actually text the agents.

Jessica had a hunch that I would fall in love with a certain unit, and she was right. Once again, she did an excellent job in helping me sort through all of the questions, details and due dates. She even arranged to reserve a certain elevator for as long as we needed, so that my movers could go back and forth with ease, saving me time and expense.

I think she really cares about the residents and it certainly shows.

After I moved in, I was unpacking on a Saturday evening and had a user-issue (yes that's me) with one of the appliances. It started beeping non-stop and I didn't know what to do. I took a chance that the office might still be open and went down to the 2nd floor. Jimiyo was downstairs in the lobby, about to leave the building. He looked up and asked if I needed help.

When I explained my dilemma, Jimiyo said that he would not only assist, but that he would come up and show me. I was floored. He was done with his day and he didn't have to help me in person, but he did.

He not only showed me how to fix the issue, but made sure I knew how to work the appliance and its features, so that I could use it on my own with confidence.

I am very happy with this building, my new apartment and the amazing service I've experienced with both Jessica and Jimiyo. I feel very lucky indeed and highly recommend living here.",5,0

2/18/2020,Robin K.,"Outstanding home, best in class service

We moved into our beautiful new home at 399 Fremont a few days ago, and are absolutely loving it here!

Jimiyo, our fantastic leasing agent, was always and continues to be there for us, going out of his way and doing all that he possibly can to answer all our questions and help out with minor issues that we found after moving in, making sure they were addressed immediately and to our full satisfaction.

Touring the property with Jimiyo was absolutely fantastic, as he explained everything in great detail, with a level of passion, enthusiasm and detailed knowledge that we'd never seen anywhere else while touring over 10 properties in total here in the city. He pointed out all the wonderful highlights of the building as well as every apartment that we looked at, and gave us all the time we needed to look around, ask questions, check availabilities and so on, it simply could not have been any better.

We are also super happy with our new home here, the apartment is absolutely outstanding, the staff and concierge are super friendly and it is a truly wonderful community overall.

Also, the apartment appears to be very well isolated, as we haven't heard any noise from outside or from our neighbors whatsoever.

If you're looking for a new home, I very strongly recommend 399 Fremont.",5,0

- Maintenance team are great, quick to respond and job done well. Shout out to Josh and Dave.

- Leasing team are nice, shout out to Alanna who does her best to try and help accommodate our asks/needs.

- At reception the team are lovely, always greeting us with a smile and always somehow in a good mood! Shout out to Crystal and Jezza.

To respond to other folks unnecessarily marking low stars:

*Food smells - do not travel from my experience. Replace air filters every 6 months to avoid this.

*Elevators - We have 3 that service all floors, and an additional 2 that service -1 to 8.  Schindler's own/operate the lift as a service. Over the 3 years here I've had max 7-10 days disrupted total due to elevators down seems like a pretty good overall service to me.

*Rent increase - are commonplace and mine were very reasonable, and inline with my expectations.",5,0
9/7/2019,Theaura K.,"I moved into this building in April, 2019. I immediately fell in love with the floor plan, the bay view, the city view, the apartment features, and the friendly courteous professional staff from Day 1.  The new resident services manager, Lorri, who started about 2 months before I moved in is such a wonderful professional courteous helpful person who would not hesitate to personally assist you with locating a missing package or helping you gain access back to your apartment after leaving your key in there. Lorri would maintain a delightful pleasant demeanor and courteous tone no matter how hectic things got around here at the front desk.  I find her even more helpful than the members of the actual Concierge team.   Sr. Assistant Community Director, Delainey, was super friendly and helpful with my move-in.  I showed up without an appointment to tour the apartment after almost signing a lease with the building across the street, and Delainey took the time to personally show me around, and I made the decision to move in afterwards.  The maintenance engineer, Dave, is such a delightful person to deal with.  Positive friendly attitude, courteous prompt assistance as always.  I very much enjoy living here because of the management and maintenance team.  I moved here from Washington DC in April, and 399 welcomed me warmly.  Thank you!",5,0

Outdoor pool and spa with killer gym 3.) the staff is cool, fun, and always on top of things 4.) little touches like new pool table, book club, and fresh cookies/flowers/goodies all around 5.) best rooftop and lounge areas 6.) awesome offices on demand at no cost 7.) being high on the hill and away from lots of new buildings there's plenty of wonderful views.

I had stopped by at least 3 different times throughout the month of May to show some of my family and friends and each time, they were very accommodating. They allowed us on the 5th floor and were warm and welcoming to all the guests. Delainey was a huge asset and was extremely helpful and attentive throughout the entire process. She is thorough, responsive and eager to make sure your event is absolutely perfect. We were allowed to bring our own decorations, alcohol and food which was great. I loved that the kitchen was hidden in the back but there is a gorgeous island in the middle of the venue where friends can gather, drink and eat.  All my guest LOVED the venue--it was intimate, yet very spacious. I highly recommend using the space and also Delainey Holt and her team. Thank you for making my baby shower so special.",5,0

3/25/2018,Joshua W.,"399 Fremont is easily my favorite place to live in SF after ~13 years in towers and luxury buildings in SF.

Tldr; I stayed in 399 as a weekend guest of a friend during a year I was traveling, and liked staying here enough to move into an apartment here 3 months later.  If you like clean, modern, convenient, and things like high speed 1gig internet, it's been 4 months for me and I keep finding new things to love about this home:)

Background and detail:
When I first started visiting, I was struck by the friendly and welcoming community of residents AND staff.  After the first weekend I spent here, I walked away feeling like I'd made some friends and that the concierge desk had made the effort to learn my name and story and proactively help me... even though I was only in town for a weekend.

Flash forward through 3 months of visiting this building and quite a few others when in town for work (I was lucky enough to have friends in many of the nearby ""similar complexes"") and I can state with a great deal of confidence: ** 399 is the best luxury building in San Francisco. **

I truly enjoy all of the beautiful amenities the building has to offer.  It's great to live in a place that your friends ask if they can come over and hang on a regular basis:)

It wouldn't feel like the home we have here without the wonderful management team and staff. Kristie and her team always go above and beyond to take care of anything that may come up (feel free to message me if you want a reference or examples).

They truly make this place feel like a community.

If you're looking into moving, and are looking for the best, definitely pay 399 a visit, take a quick tour, and make a friend or two:).  

(Note, I wasn't offered any special treatment for making this post and I've lived 4+ months in this apartment. If anything, I just want to make sure the staff gets credit for the hard work they put in to make this a great place to live:)",5,0

Can't speak enough good words about Lawrence and Stanley, and the rest of the amazing crew who makes our lives easier and more pleasant! They are always super helpful, understanding and responsive.

The apartments are very stylishly designed, super sleek and neat, and we had never had any problems with anything being broken and not fixed: we had to fix the icing machine in the fridge once, and the building service team was on it the next day - very efficient and quick!

Lastly, we love our neighbors: it is a very close friendly community of young professionals and really interesting people, and it is great to socialize together at pool parties, fireplace wine nights or rainy day BBQs.

I will highly recommend this place to everyone who is looking for a beautiful home with wonderful neighbors and staff!",5,0
10/19/2016,Kim M.,"We are commuters from the east coast and have been at 399 Fremont now for about four months.   I wanted to highlight how great the building and amenities are of course, but in particular I wanted to thank Jonathan at the concierge desk and his colleague Alicia.    They have been outstanding in every way, and no request was ever too small or painful for them (and boy did we have a lot!).    Knowing that we have them looking out for us, especially when we are not there, is quite comforting.   We can't say enough good things about them, and the entire staff at 399 Fremont!",5,0
9/30/2016,Scot V.,"My partner and I moved to San Francisco in June and frankly our experience in the city was not the best.   We were not assimilating as well as expected and contemplated moving. We were so happy and grateful to discover 399 Fremont and Sarah F. who was our leasing agent.  She introduced the beautiful property to us and made us feel so welcomed to our new home and family. 399 is our family and unfortunately we are relocating to Denver. We immediately sought out the UDR property in Denver. We are happy to report the UDR in Denver appears to have the same values and spirit. The transfer was so seamless and executed without problems by Sarah and Katie.
We will miss our 399 Fremont family and highly recommend anyone searching for a new home to visit 399 Fremont and ask for Sarah F.

We couldn't be happier with the choice.",5,0
4/15/2021,Luna P.,"I moved in soon after the building started leasing units. Christina was amazing (understatement) helping me through the lease, doing phone tours (I was moving from out of state) and just so much more than any apartments ever did for me before. I was super impressed with the units, the craftsmanship and the amenities. Walk in closets, roof top pool and hot tub, theatre room, penthouse clubroom on the 40th floor, free espresso... It goes on. Oh, and the elevators are SO FAST. The rooms are really quiet when you close all the windows, even when people have loud cars, construction, you name it.

The neighborhood is wonderful, kind of stuck right between everything. Within a 15 minute walk of so much stuff. I have not been able to explore much with covid but the location is awesome.

The front desk has been great too, especially Joe! There isn't a lot of interaction with covid but they always go out of there way for you, are super helpful and professional and always available. Everyone who works here is leagues beyond any concierge team I've ever experienced.",5,0
3/28/2021,Brendan L.,"Have lived in the building since August, beautiful spaces and even better people. Every time I walk in the front door I am sure to be met with a huge smile from Joe or any one of the wonderful team members (Shannon, Parham, Courtney, & Natasha) Thanks for all you do!",5,0

3/6/2021,Leslie T.,"There's a lot to love about Fifteen Fifty Mission, from the high-end fixtures and aesthetics of the units-to the frankly luxurious amenities including pool, lounges and reservable conference rooms. But beautiful design and thoughtful spaces aside, a home isn't a peaceful and welcoming home without the amazing and attentive team that supports this building and make living here so great!

From first introduction and remote viewing, Jason Sypult made my decision an easy one. He was so incredibly helpful and responsive-always at the ready to my questions and made the move in process -and beyond-an incredibly positive experience. The concierge team are stellar! Joe, Danny, Natasha, Shannon and Parham I send you huge thanks for making daily living easy and enjoyable. Same shout out to the very responsive and professional maintenance and cleaning teams, Kristie Lober and Related building management who really are dedicated to making residents happy.

3/4/2021,Evan P.,"Just moved into the building a few weeks ago and I love it! The space is amazing but the thing that makes it feel like home are the people that work here.

Jason Sypult was my leasing agent and was super patient and responsive throughout my whole leasing experience. He answered every question, text, and call I had very quickly and made sure I had all the information I needed.

After moving in the front desk/ concierge team has been amazing! Every single one of them has always helped with a smile on their face (through the mask) and have made this building truly feel like home. From simple things like remembering my name to calling an elevator for me the team at the front desk has always gone above and beyond to make my experience here at 1550 the best. Special shout-out to Joe, Natasha, & Parham! You guys are amazing!",5,0
3/4/2021,James H.,"I moved in right when the building opened and have been very happy! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Jason Sypult was the leasing agent who helped me and has always been extremely responsive -- helping me with a number of things, even after moving in.

The units themselves look great and all of the finishes are high quality. The walls and ceilings are solid & the windows are very insulated -- I never hear my neighbors and rarely hear noise from the street.

The amenities are great -- dog park, underground parking, dog grooming area, building gym, pool, hot tub, co-working space with conference rooms, private park, and more! Very dog friendly, too! Looking forward to the Equinox opening up soon as well.

Not a ton of stuff in the very immediate neighborhood, but a short walk to Hayes Valley or the Mission for bars and restaurants. And a Whole Foods, Safeway, and upscale market (Market on Market) all within a few blocks.

Everyday things like receiving packages and food/grocery delivery is very smooth.

Overall, this has been a great place to live",5,0

3/2/2021,Eliza W.,"I've always been hesitant about living in big buildings because they usually don't feel homey but Fifteen Fifty is literally the perfect place to live. All of the finishings and amenities are top tier/great quality.

I love how friendly the staff are...some of them feel like family because they're always looking out for us and always so fun to catch up with. If you're lucky, you'll be greeted by Joe or Shannon who are my absolute favorite guys. They really make this place feel like home!",5,0
3/2/2021,Jordan B.,"...There's no place like home, and I've never lived anywhere like FifteenFifty.

Pool and hot tub? Check?
19inch deep tubs in the bathrooms? Check. Appliances camouflaged to look like cabinets? Check.
Neat little workstation with automatic coffee maker so you can work from home without feeling trapped in your apartment because the entire world is on pandemic lockdown and your office has to be vacated? Check.
Friendly staff to greet you when you get home? Check.

We moved in before most of the amenities were available after a tour from Jason Sypult, who is among the more lovely humans you are likely to meet in SF. I'd say that means we got less of an experience of living here, but the quality of our living space is so high that we were able to find ways to treat living here like being on a cruise ship. YouTube Yoga in the living room? You bet. Yoga in the park (did you know there's a park ""in"" the building?) and yoga in one of the empty Penthouses absolutely happened. When we could have folks visit (when CoViD tiers allowed), we made sure to take them to the penthouse club and deck because the views are spectacular.

Being able to just walk into Hayes Valley or the Mission from here to enjoy the closed street days has been a godsend (like shore leave at a port). Parking in the protected garage below the building has been super easy, and this location makes getting to the highway or up to market street to get to the western and northern parts of the city super easy. Valet service in the garage is something I didn't know I wanted before I moved in.

At ground level, SF is SF. You will occasionally run into stuff that isn't safe or savory when you walk out the doors. That said, you have to walk outside to look up at this building to see how gorgeous it is. Nothing else in the city looks like FifteenFifty, and catching the angles off of it an sunset is a treat. If you don't spend any time at ground level, you won't get a chance to interact with the stellar concierge staff, who are among the most valuable aspects of living here. Also, it's SF, if you're here, then you're used to it by now.

Take a tour, see it for yourself. Or just drive up South Van Ness and gawk at it (we've watched people park to take pictures). Either way, great place to live.",5,0
9/3/2020,Shan S.,"Moved into 1550 recently and I wanted to share my experience. Jason Sypult made my decision to move in incredibly easy and has been a valuable resource the entire time. Every single aspect of moving into this building has been easy, friendly and reliable, and Jason has been incredibly responsive and flexible at all hours of the day (and sometimes night) whenever I have a question or concern. On top of that this building is absolutely beautiful, and both the amenities and the finishes inside of the apartment are high quality and thoughtful and functional.",5,0
8/24/2020,Christopher O.,"I recently moved into Fifteen Fifty Mission with my partner, and we are thrilled with our choice to live here. The building and apartments have a modern design, the amenities are first rate (and include a pool, fitness center, business center, library, screening room, and more), and the staff are friendly and helpful. The building is also easy walking distance to the best parts of San Francisco (e.g., the Mission, the Castro, Civic Center, and so forth).

I was especially impressed with Jason Sypult, the leasing agent. He was so knowledgable and passionate. He answered all of our questions, he quickly responded to all our requests, and he made sure we got the unit that worked best for us. His passion was instrumental in us choosing to live at Fifteen Fifty Mission.

5/7/2020,Charlie K.,"Looked at this building seriously when moving from New York. Almost signed but decided on a condo instead. Building is gorgeous, amenities are more similar to a luxury hotel.

The most amazing part about Alchemy is that with all these merits, it's still so clean, beautiful, safe and quiet. Staffs here are always the best help you could find (especially Jenna, our superstar), and neighbors are all respectful and welcoming as well.

If you're at all nervous and unsure David is your guy. He was amazing and most of all patient. I came back twice as I was unsure and he helped me find a great place. Other agents I met with in the city acted as if I was the lucky one to even get a chance to meet with them. Coming from Los Angeles and dealing with a list celebrities for my job it's shocking that the celebrities were often times easier and more approachable than some rental agents in SF. Thanks, David and the rest of the team at alchemy!",5,0
9/21/2018,Adam A.,"Alchemy is by far one of the best apartments and communities that I have lived in. This luxury-style residential space has everything I need and more. As a Nurse, my home is my sanctuary and I value every last square foot of it. I have been living in Alchemy since November 2016 and seen the transition of ownership from Alta to Holland. I have come to know each individual in the leasing office and feel like they each know who I am and what my needs are. With Holland's takeover, the close-knit community thrives with social get-togethers and a strong sense of peace, unity and respect. This community welcomes all new incomers openly and respectfully. Within the grounds, there's a subset of happy dogs and owners in this pet-friendly environment that frequently play and socialize, along with some community dog walkers! Holland maintains a healthy and respectable set of rules that accommodate all those pet-friendly/not. There's so much that Holland and this community has to offer. If you're interested in knowing more, stop by the leasing office and ask for Jenna. Jenna is one of the best ""community caretakers"" that this community has to offer.",5,0

12/2/2009,David C.,"I was employed by the Monroe Residence Club for about 6 months from last October, through April.  I am a full time student, and had recently lost my job, and couldn't afford rent.  A friend of mine had recently been employed on a worktrade system, and it was a more appealing option than couchsurfing while i looked for work.

From a ""caring about those who care for you"" point of view.  They make the majority of their employees stay in ""sub levels.""  They are in tiny, shared, mold filled rooms, that have the tendency to make everyone sick.  They started remodeling the rooms just as I was leaving, so they could be a little better now.

They pay their staff minimum wage, and incredibly inflexible about work schedules, the employees arent allowed to use the kitchen, and they have to have overnight guests pre-approved. Not to  mention they are abusive to their employees.  I was fired when the general manager, James, came into the Kitchen, where I worked, screaming at us and slamming doors, for nothing, and I told him it wasnt ok for him to talk to us like that.

There also was rampant drug and alcohol problems amongst the employees while i worked there.  Im not talking about smoking some weed or getting wasted on the weekends either.

Then from a resident's point of view.
The kitchen is GROSS!  The dressing, butter, etc, from the salad bar, and tables, gets scraped back out, and put in the fridge for the next meal.  Its often mixed with spilled salad, crumbs, people caugh germs, you name it.  The floor gets hosed down, but never scrubbed.  Meat that doesnt get served gets put in the fridge to be reworked into another dish, sometimes over a week later.

The food quality is the lowest end of sysco style catering food.  most people develop digestive problems while they are there.

And they clean their soft serve icecream machine with a cleaner that is labeled as TOXIC!

The cost is outrageous for what you receive.  Housing prices in SF are high, but with some hunting you can find a place for 600 bucks, with your own room, a kitchen that you can use, sane neighbors, and you get to feed yourself real food.

I can  not discourage people from staying here enough.  San Francisco is a much cooler city than this residence hotel gives the impression of.  Polk street is not a ""cool"" neighborhood to hang out in, and its not so cool for college aged students to be shushed in the lobby.",1,0
12/26/2008,Brian H.,"I have remained in this hell hole for two and a half years only due to the fact of the ridiculously high rents in San Francisco .
Where to start. First the manager is a paranoid little man who needs to be in complete charge of everything. BEWARE he also has had sixteen sexual harassment suits against him and the hotel in the past several  years.
The rooms are OK but the food sucks for the price. The WI_FI they offer is a joke. This is run like a college dorm with guests having to sign a register and there are no quests after 10:00 pm ..
If you are looking for a place to stay I'd choose a nice bed and breakfast rather than this dump.
As for myself I am moving within a few weeks.",1,0
12/13/2018,Doug K.,"In 1968 I was a new computer salesman - a ""missionary salesman"" they called it - for the RCA Corporation, covering the banks of San Francisco.  After finishing training in Cherry Hill NJ, I boarded a United Air Lines 707 in New York City and landed in San Francisco.  My office was in the financial district, and another salesman suggested that I check out the ""Monroe Club"" on Sacramento St. near Van Ness Avenue.  I did so and took the big private room on the second floor just above the cozy lobby with the fireplace and the elevator.  Private bath, phone, double bed, big three window bay window overlooking Sacramento St.  Not much closet space. Noisy at night.  I think I paid $220/month.  Walked to work on clear days, on rainy days (there were many of them) I took the cable car a block away down California St. I stayed at the Monroe Club for about 18 months; compared to the Marine Barracks of my recent experience it was ok; but not as clean. Food about the same.  RCA was constantly sending me back to Cherry Hill for more training, so I would check out,  leave for two or three months on the East Coast, come back to SF and get in line for the ""nice rooms"",staying in whatever ""single room/shared bath"" that was available.  On one of these ventures I go a really low class single room w/shared bath, about halfway down the long hall on the second floor.  I think that I was in that room for two or three weeks - until my favorite room opened up.  One afternoon I came home to find my window missing (!)  The entire frame was gone!  A pidgeon was perched on the window sill checking out my possessions. (This was in November; a chill wind was blowing!)  I called management at the front desk, and was informed that the handyman (Mr. Mulaney) had taken the broken frame to the repair shop and would be back with a new window ""shortly"".  I went out for dinner and drinks, came back at 11:00 pm to find no change in the window situation.  I went to bed; all night the cold San Francisco fog billowed around me, all night I was troubled by the meloncholy ""woooooop!"" ""wooooop!"" of the foghorn on Alcatraz island in the bay - probably the worst night I had spent since those in the jungles of Vietnam.  The next day management informed me that Mr. Mulaney had been given cash to pay the repair shop for the new window, and had siezed the opportunity to have a few drinks at the Club's expense.  He left my window in some bar somewhere in Oakland; it was never found again.  The Club replace Mulaney and my window in a day or two and gave me a refund on the rent.
I have shunned fog and the Monroe Club, since then!",3,0
5/10/2015,Chloë L.,"I arrived in the Monroe at the beginning of July 2014 and I stayed there for exactly 4 weeks. During this month, I shared my bedroom with another women and we had to share the showers with the all floor. I think the Monroe it's a good residence for all the European going to San Francisco. You meet there a lot of young people going from a large part of the world.
I agree the room wasn't perfectly clean everyday but it's never seem dirty to me. The room was very small and it was sometimes difficult to find a place to put our bag.
The situation is perfect for me, more or less 15 minutes by walk to Market Street or a bus stop just near the residence; 10 minutes by walk to the fisherman Wharf or also a bus. Near a big supermarket and a post office.
In brief, If I had to go back one day alone in San Francisco, I would probably choose to stay in the Monroe. But I don't suggest this residence to family, it's quite noisy, a lot of international students, shared bathroom..",3,0

9/8/2021,Samantha W.,"I would not recommend living here. Packages are constantly stolen. The mailboxes are broken into and management does nothing about it. The management is very uncompassionate about the issues around their lack of security. Desiree and Amy are very unhelpful with resolving issues. You have to pay for sewer, water, and garbage. There are plenty of lofts in this area and I highly recommend living at another.

I would like to follow up to Amy's comment because there are lies within the response. You did not work with me on the parking situation. My parking permit was stolen from your mailboxes that were broken into inside the building. I spoke with SFMTA today and they are issuing me a new one. You are not allowing me to park in the garage while I await my new parking permit.

You never gave me a new key when you gave me one that does not work, even though I put in a request for it.

You also were not upfront about how much utilities cost. Desiree told me utilities cost less than they did. When I questioned her about it she told me she quoted me what it would cost for one person, when my application had always been for 2 people. She also overcharged my move in fee. I had noticed the error going through my lease and was the one to bring up this error.",1,0
7/12/2020,Damian H.,"Good luck tenants. I will give you both sides of this residence.
Pros- Building is clean and units are well maintained.
- staff is great
-Maintenance is on top of it
-Units block sound

Cons- RENT PRICES BEWARE! I have been here 2 years. First year, fair, second year 10% max increase. 3rd year COVID, 3% reduction offer with 6 weeks free rent. NOW, unit next door that is larger and renovated is for rent 17% less than mine and 8 weeks free rent, so loyal tenants get the middle finger.
- Homeless is insane and screaming daily outside, with shelter around the corner.
- NEW BUILDING BEING BUILT. This is directly across the street. 12 stories and 2 years of construction. Good luck on sleep with jackhammers and trucks blocking road for development. They will not tell you this.
- Neighbors are not friendly. Maybe it is an SF thing, but I have only made friends with 1 neighbor in 2 years and all others do not talk to you, close elevator before you get in, walk by and stare at ground without saying hello. Totally disconnected from reality and lack of social skills.
-Human feces on street. This is no joke. Take a drive around the block and you will see your friendly neighbors.

1/27/2021,Anonymous A.,"We LOVED living here and would easily move here again. The staff is attentive and the building is spacious and great. Special shoutout to Desiree and Amy for being amazing staff.

The pros are:
*Gorgeous units
*Amazing Staff
*Nice Community
*Safe

The cons are very minor but we did experience occasional package theft but the staff was helpful and put up frosted glass within a day of suggesting it which was really thoughtful. The units are on the more pricey side but it is San Francisco after-all.

Overall 5/5 - would recommend and will miss this place.",5,0
8/18/2008,Lacey S.,"Horrible experience!  I was moving in from Indiana and found this place, it was the only place I could apply for without actually being there ahead of time.

Anyhow... My move in date got moved back three times because they kept saying the apartment just couldn't be ready by then.  I had already rented a truck and had to take it back the day after my first scheduled move in date.  

She called me and asked if I could send in my deposit. Since I was on the road it was easier for me to get on their rent payment website, which charges $35 to make a payment through there. But then a few days later she called and said she made a mistake so I actually owed $480 more.

Natalya, said we could have a room with a view of the ocean, I thought ahh how nice will that be to watch the sunsets. Well I got there to sign the lease and it was nothing but a view of the other building's balconies.

I blew all that off cause I was sick of hotel rooms and just wanted to get my stuff unpacked and unwind, so I signed the lease.  Something came up the day after the lease signing and I was not going to be able to stay  there. I thought... oh no big deal I read about a 30 day guarantee in the lease agreement. So when I called about it I wanted to deal with someone that knew what was going on so I asked for the property manager, Dave.  Dave said, ""the way the lease is worded we do not have to let you terminate the lease. It is at our discretion.""  And then something like he could hold me to the full years lease legally. So they are keeping my $1999 deposit, and I have never been inside of the actual apartment, and the lease was not to start until the day after I terminated my lease.

They do get one star for the convenience. But from what I saw on the tour of the building, it was nothing special and nothing I would call nice. Why not just rent a house for about the same amount, not have to haul my crap 5 stories into the air, enjoy my privacy, with a real ocean view, and live in a little more clean setting.",1,0
8/16/2013,Melina G.,"The staff are really friendly even though I'm sure they must be getting sick of accepting all my online purchases and delivering them to my apartment (a perk which I am loving), my apartment is huge for a 1-bedroom with an unbeatable floor plan and floor to ceiling windows and the location is brilliant. I catch the light rail to work or walk into downtown and both are very quick and convenient. Not to mention Downtown  is gorgeous on the weekend and there is a supermarket down the street.The apartment complex itself is like living in a hotel. The amenities are brilliant and it seems underutilized so you can almost always enjoy them whenever you feel like it. Yes, it would be great if the lounge etc (which has free wi-fi!) was open 24/7 like the gym but that's just being fussy. The regular community events are great too - an excellent way to get to know your neighbours and something which I really value since I'm new to the area. My apartment faces the street but the noise doesn't bother me in the slightest. I guess if you were sensitive to noise perhaps you would prefer a pool-facing apartment but I really enjoy the sunlight from the outside.Overall, I am very happy living at Avalon. Check it out!",3,0

They care about the experience of the tenants and quickly respond to any needs of our apartment.  They take the time to talk to our kids and get to know us.  The apartment itself is great.  The walls are sound proof (not sure if they technically are, but no one has heard our kids and we have never heard any of our neighbors babies cry).  The laundry facilities onsite are wonderful and parking is great for having friends come over.  The location is really nice.  There are so many restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, etc within walking distance.  If you have kids there are several playgrounds within walking distance as well.  We love this place!",5,0

The building is next to Mt. Sutro Open Space.. Being next to the mountain makes it very quiet. If you're on the mountain side you can see hawks flying. The building was built in the 60s so it doesn't have all the amenities of newer complexes, but the architecture is sound and Avalon has done a great job of maintaining it. They recently went through major remodeling work, which was very noisy. But that is over. They do convert older apartments as they become vacant so there is occasional noise, but not like before as some reviews mention. Whenever I've had a maintenance issue the staff were there within an hour even at night. Tthe office staff are very friendly and helpful..",5,0

My opinion: yeah, there's noise but it goes with the work, you can't expect machinery to be quiet!  Place is going to look very nice after it's all done.  Way to go Sunset!

To rebuttal Betty J - hey - you should have done your research more extensively, you could have found out BEFORE you moved in there is a pet deposit AND no amenities.

4/14/2011,Aja B.,"I""ve lived at Avalon Sunset Towers for several years now and find the comments by Mr. Bruce H. very offensive and libel.  There is NO asbestos at Sunset Towers!  There is NO white powder in the hallways! I think Mr. H is a bored person with nothing to do but malign a good company and good people.  I was outside about 2 weeks ago walking my dog, as I was making my way to the main entrance, I notice Mr. H was also walking his dog but his dog was not on a leash.  The manager asked him politely to put his dog on a leash and Mr. H lashed out in a very vulgar manner.  Then he yelled at the manager that he would see him in court?  For what? Seriously, he's going to sue Avalon because he was told to put his dog on a leash which is a city regulation when you are outside?  Mr. H. if you have lung cancer you probably gave it to yourself because you did not get it from here!

Yes, Sunset Towers is currently under construction.  They are making the building inside and out more beautiful and better - what more could a resident want?  We are told in a timely manner what they will be doing and for how long.  Management is always willing to help.  They are considerate and kind.  If anyone is unhappy, then just move out!

P.S.  - By the way - how did that court day go - the one where you were suing one of the staff?  Did ya win?",5,0
4/15/2021,Jill B.,"Lovvve this location!! Five stars on this property due to Nancy G. On-sight property manager (Nancy) is on her game completely. She is 100% dedicated to resident satisfaction, which is a rarity in property management. I am a resident and a realtor, as well. Know this from the inside and professionally. There are nightmare stories and scenarios of property managers in every city. Just read your local Next Door for proof. Nancy is present, smiling, an active listener, and insightful. She creates a great energy in the building. Introduces newcomers, always finding solutions to anything, and consistently making efforts to make this an awesome address.
Workers and residents are masked, there's a locked lobby, great parking garage, the units are spacious and many are renovated, the street views are residential and charming, and the sweeping bay views are spectacular.

Construction will be noisy, will create traffic, and the management has been keeping this quiet while aggressively encouraging people to renew their leases early before they realize this is about to happen.

Updated review",Colin D.,"Overall, our year stay at 2000 Post was horrible. We had issues throughout the year which we spoke to building management about several times, and none of these issues were ever resolved. The amount that we had to pay per month for what we put up with is ridiculous. The only good thing about this terrible place was Chris the maintenance guy.

To start, our move out process was horrible. When we had our move out inspection, they told us we would be charged huge amounts of money to have our place cleaned. This is ridiculous. Throughout our stay there have been construction workers in and out, dust throughout the halls and air, etc which directly affected the cleanliness of our apartment. We have kept it clean to the best we could with normal wear and tear and should absolutely not be charged this amount, especially when much of the dust and dirt is from construction.

At one point during our time here, there were issues with the sewage in our building, resulting in both our sink and toilet exploding with sewage water all over our bathroom and into our kitchen. While they did clean it up, at no point was our unit steam cleaned or professionally cleaned. Why should I have to pay over $300 when this standard was not even provided for me when I lived there?

Besides that, there have been broken elevators, mice,etc. One of the worst was at one point there were squatters in an apartment cooking drugs!!!!!!!! This has been by far the worst place I have ever lived. If I were you, I would avoid at all costs!",1,0
4/15/2011,Kevin L.,"The building itself is fine.  The people were for the most part nice.  However, you should expect the smell of cigarettes to come through your bathroom air vent, frequent fire alarms, frequent malfunctioning laundry rooms, ridiculous cleaning fees when you move out and clans of bums loitering around the building.  

I put up with it the entire time I was living here and probably wouldn't be writing this review if the management would have handled my final move-out bill a little better.  Long story short, they forgot to send it to my new address.  When I emailed to inquire about the amount, they sent me an email and told me to send a check in 15 days.  12 days later, with my check in the mailbox, I got a call from a credit collector saying I needed to electronically transfer money immediately or I would have a ding on my credit.  So far, I've spent 30 minutes on the phone with a credit collector trying to ensure that the $250 I owe for my final move-out doesn't screw up my credit.  The fact that I'm even dealing with this is absolutely absurd and completely irresponsible by the 2000 Post Management.  

I wouldn't have any faith that they'll make sure you're taken care of.  Consider yourself warned.",1,0
4/9/2010,Ben A.,"Would have rated 0-1/2 a star if possible. Management and customer service are extremely poor. They are very friendly to potential residents, but just wait until you move in...seriously the worst is Danielle. Stay away from her at all costs. She's pleasant when trying to sell you something, but the moment you have a question, something doesn't work right or the building has an issue, she'll be the first to turn her back and blame you for it. They have absolutely no intent to keep residents happy or satisfied. No value for the money either.

This place is dingy. Don't let the pictures fool you. Inside, apartments are sprayed with a thin layer of paint and stink of cigarettes. Mine was even recarpeted and painted before I moved in. One of the worst decisions I've ever made! Save your money or spend the same elsewhere for a far better deal. The area is also sketchy and they rent out parking to the public, so you never know who's going in and out of the garage.",1,0
3/1/2010,bryan d.,"Pros:

Nice Pool/ decent gym
Good Location
Friendly Staff - on the surface

Cons:

-Stupidly overpriced
-No utilities at all are included
-Terrible unbelievably slow elevators
-Overpriced parking
-Unbelievably loud fire alarms that go off regularly in the middle of the night. In my 13 LONG months there I was rattled out of my sleep at least 3/4 times, with another 2/3 times during waking hours.
- If you're on the outside face of the building, the noise from Geary and the sports fields is considerable. Every Saturday and Sunday be ready to hear whistles and cheering and screaming all day long.
- They make you sign a 13 month lease and will screw you for every penny of it. I had to give my 30 day notice (if you go month-to-month your rate skyrockets upward by roughly $500/mo) and found a new place that required me to move in a couple weeks before my move out date of March 8th. I had the entire apartment steam cleaned and empty prior to March 1st with keys turned in, yet they still forced me to pay rent for those 8 days and were extremely obnoxious about it.
- Unless you're desperate, there are cheaper better alternatives a-plenty.",1,0

Not only is the place run down, but there is always something broken - washing maching, elevator, etc. The staff are a nightmare, except Daniel. They forget that they work for you and treat you pretty badly. Mark is the worst, totally unwilling to work with you. They have ripped me off on my security deposit, tried to make me pay the previous tenant's bills and wanted to jack up the rent when my lease came up. In this market when rents are going down?? Ridiculous. The apartments are small and very noisy. I could hear my neighbours all the time - including their dogs. Dogs are barking constantly which is really annoying when you're trying to sleep. I can't find anything good about the place. My friends who visited me told me how depressing it felt. Go look somewhere else - you'll be much happier anywhere else!",1,0
7/27/2009,sylvia t.,"So recently I came to this building to take a tour. I called one morning early and set up an appointment with Daniel. When I arrived at lunch time I was greeted by a young lady named Julie who answered all my questions willingly with a smile on her face until Daniel returned from his previous tour. Once Daniel arrived I introduced myself and he was so polite and welcoming. Which is a big deal to me. We went on our tour and he showed me the whole property from the gym and pool all the way to the other courtyard. He was great. If it was up to me I would have signed a lease that day but THANK GOODNESS I DIDN;T! I wanted to wait and go see some other properties and then come back. The day I came back neither Julie or Daniel were available to tour so unfortunately I had to get my tour with the manager. You would think this would be a positive thing until you meet her. The tour she gave was extremely lousy and horrible, so unfriendly and I felt as if she was lying to every question I asked and answering it according to some stupid corporate guidelines. She was very rude and rushed the whole tour!  WHAT KIND OF MANAGER IS THIS? I can not believe this beautiful property is managed by a person with such horrible hygeine and a horrible attitude. Sorry Daniel you can blame your manager for the reason I didn't rent..I gave the two stars because of the horrible manager and how she made me feel. Nothing to do with the looks of the property or the excellent customer service I received from Daniel. It all has to do with my second tour.",2,0

He offers quick and effective solutions for different issues and questions and he also has a great sense of humor, which I am sure is not the last thing when you have to attend to many problems of many tenants in this huge building.

The team here is courteous, highly responsive and very accommodating.  Recent reviews have highlighted Chris, Gunther, Danielle and the kudos to these individuals are richly deserved.  Chris alone has bailed me out several times when I locked myself out of my apartment.  He is great.

The tone of a community is set at the top and I commend Hyes Woo, the Community Director, for her efforts and leadership.  ""Shout outs"" go to Idiarys, Elizabeth, as well as to the cleaning/maintenance team that keeps this place clean, running smoothly and in order.  

2000 Post isn't perfect (which is the only reason for the 4 ""stars"" rating, with incentive to shoot for 5 ""stars"") but the team here tries very hard to make it so.  For this alone, I am appreciative.  Strong team responsive to residents, great location, nice place to live.  Check it out.",4,0

My favorite times in the city are cool early evenings when we can grill outside together with a few of the neighbors, and play some pool in the community room afterwards.

And there a plenty of accessible ways to get around, which is important to me.  I don't like being in a wheelchair to be a reason I can't see my son.  Instead, because of the people and facilities at 2000 Post, I have reason to look forward to it.

4/20/2016,Todd M.,"We've been residents at 2000 Post for over three years now.  The (almost completed) construction has definitely been a hassle, but we're still here, and that should tell you something.  Other than the questionable colors of the paint job on the exterior of the building, all of the new stuff (hot tub, gym, pool area, grills, lounge) is really high quality and was worth the noise.  We'll likely be here for another couple of years, high rent and all, because it's San Francisco and anything much cheaper is either really remote or a complete dump.

I'd also like to compliment the staff for the the way they've taken care of me, my wife, and my highly needy dog.  Danielle, Gunther, Idi and Cayla have been unfailingly nice to us, even when we have occasionally bent the rules a little.  Maintenance has almost always been timely as well.  We've lived in three separate units in the building, and move in and move out has always gone smoothly.

I'll add this -- I completely understand the one and two star ratings from folks that spent the majority of their time here during the construction process, which has lasted a full year at this point.  That said, it's basically over now, and I think every last thing is likely to be done by the beginning of June.  If you can afford the pricey apartments, you're really going to like it here now that everything is completed.

EDIT:  It's now September of 2016, and everything about the renovation has long since been completed.

1/14/2015,Erek G.,"My partner and I were looking for a nice clean, luxury style apartment with amenities and we thought we would check out 2000 Post just on a feeling we had.

So glad that we followed our instinct!! This property has been absolutely fantastic from the moment we began our tour with Gunther.

First and foremost, Gunther is probably one of the nicest staff members I have ever worked with. He is not only professional and knowledgeable, but his interaction with you is more like a friend and very personable. His service is impeccable but even more importantly he wants to help you in every way possible. It is a trait that is refreshing and deserves recognition and mention ;-) Thank you Gunther for everything!!!

Not to mention, his interaction with your pets is so cute and caring.

We knew within the first 5 minutes of the tour that this was going to be our residence of choice.

The amenities that are included, set this property apart by long strides. When you consider the amount for rent and what you get with it, there is simply no comparison. From multiple multiple laundry rooms, pool, spa, fitness center, landscaped gardens, grill areas, front concierge, package delivery and more this property sets itself apart from the rest.

Without needing to be said, we chose this property for our residence.

From the moment we showed up with our moving truck, we were once again welcomed by Gunther right out front and we did our walk through. He took his time with us and was literally excited that we have arrived at our new home. He was just as happy as we were, and you could tell that he really cared.

Anything we needed touched up, which was practically nothing, was taken care of immediately.

Which brings me to maintenance. This maintenance staff is simply unbelievable and remarkable. I have lived in several communities and this team is what all maintenance crews in all properties should model themselves after. When you need something done, they are right there to do it, within a very fast manner, and happily. That speaks monumentally.

Chris in particular is who we have worked with and his service is 100% fantastic. He takes pride in his work and already knew our name to say hello when he arrived. He goes above and beyond in every situation and always wants to make you sure you have everything you need taken care of. Wow!! The professionalism of this staff is superb.

Overall the office staff, maintenance staff, beautiful apartments, surrounding area of parks, shopping, grocery, entertainment, restaurants, etc. is something that most would desire. The pacific heights area in general is one heck of nice area and has everything that you need or could want and getting to any other area of the city is a breeze ;-)

Would highly recommend this property to anyone.

Looking forward to living in this wonderful community ;-)

I loved living at 2000 Post, it is ideally located to many things in the heart of the Fillmore District and I would look forward to my weekends wondering around Fillmore. The property has everything I could want; a pool, gym, parking, washer and dryers and a wonderful staff. They were very helpful during my move and it made it a very easy transition for me!",5,0

1/20/2010,Peter C.,"I found this weekly rental just start from $490 in this good location.
(UCSF/COLE Valley/Haight ashbury/Downtown).  This is a hotel apartment style building.

Frist, I stay for a week and then I love to stay there for another week. The room with internet/TV/sink which is  very comfortable and plus large window with Sunny sunset view/fresh air.  They provide daily cleaning in all common areas.

I enjoy to use their large eat in kitchen areas and sunny sitting room.  

Job, project and rotation or new to city  and try to settle down or relocate to find ideal place.

Everything here is just in 5-10 minutes walking distance.  

Two way public transportation in fornt the building take you to downtown and ocean beach/goldern gate bridge in just 15-20 minutes.  Quiet building under good management.  The operator provide good services.
