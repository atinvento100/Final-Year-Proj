2/10/2021,Marie S.,-1,1.0,Lakewood is the new ghetto by the beach! Tenants banging all hours of the night management puts a letter on everyone door. Cars are being broken into and tenants are being harassed. Management does nothing and the unfriendly staff in the leasing office does nothing to help the situation. Do not move here if you can find something better! Good news Lakewood accepts Section 8 now and you see druggies hanging in the hallways and garage all day long.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

O yeah and let's not forget you have San Francisco police department shooting range across the street firing their guns all day and night!  Not safe while living there was woken up by a guy busting a guy breaking into his car, having a altercation with him and then chasing him.  Management is rude and unprofessional .  When moving out shampooed my carpet twice and they still charged me $100.00 and when I questioned it they were rude about it and still charged me.  I'm just glad to be out of there and don't want to think of this nightmare anymore.  I just wanted to warn people so they don't go through what I did.  Don't do it!","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

11/1/2015,Mark A.,-1,1.0,"This place is total crap hole. The halls wreak of mildew, the carpet needed to be replaced like 15 years ago, there is often garbage in the garage which is always fun when you walk out the door and are greeted by a hissing raccoon which the management also denies/ignores as a problem. If you ever have anything delivered here you have a 50/50 of either getting it or having it stolen. The layout of the apartments is very odd, you can literally walk down a hall and the apartments are label something like 405, 406, 410, 408, 415, etc...it makes no sense. Also, there's a $22 million project across the street to clean up 80 years' worth of shotgun pellets and busted clay pigeons that litter the lakeside skeet- and trap-shooting range. I look forward to my cancer diagnosis in 20 years. You're better off finding something in the Sunset or Daly City.","San Francisco, CA",0,12,N/A,0

It has been a a month. I have had a horrible altercation in the office with the manager Haley Gonzabos. She needs to take a management seminar and learn how to catch some flies with honey. The employees don't even look up when you walk in. They only talk to ""prospective"" tenants, not the existing tenants. I am out of here in 11 months.

They only let you  pick them up between 8-9am and 5-6pm, that's it, no exceptions. I work. 2 jobs. 7 days a week. Yes, I work very hard. Times are tough. I walk in to get my package after they left a message on my phone to come pick it up. They refuse. The manager is there, Haley. I explain to her the situation, she says, ""If I break the rules for you, I have to break the rules for everyone"". I have contacted the San Francisco rent board and they are very interested in what is going on. The office staff is just so confrontational every time I walk in.

This is the unfriendliest group of employees I have ever met.  It is so sad, i love this place. It is beautiful here. Like a suburb in the city, but the staff ruins my day every time I see them. I wish I had talked to the residents before I moved in. I have been here 3 months and am looking to break my lease. I hope people read this board.","San Francisco, CA",0,3,N/A,0
11/3/2008,Nikki F.,-1,1.0,"The residents are rude. Their was often a baby crying and someone shouted ""Shut your F*cking kid up!"" People don't hold the elevators for you, so rude. In addition, my car was just stolen from my own parking space in the apartment parking garage. Poor security if you ask me.

The snack vending machine has been broken for more than a month now and it ate my roommate's money. The coke is always sold out in the vending machine on my floor, so I always have to walk to the rec center to get a coke.","San Francisco, CA",1,1,N/A,0
7/20/2014,K H.,-1,2.0,"First, the people in the office are friendly.
The location is not the best. It sits in a gully of cold and fog. You need a vehicle for sure. The noise level is bad. All day & night you hear the constant guns going off from the police range. They shoot well past 11pm at times. The highway with constant cars & trucks that you need to keep the windows closed to hear the tv.
The apartment is always cold like an air conditioner was on super cold. The cost to use their baseboard heat is super expensive - over a $380 electric bill.  The dampness in the apartment is very bad as well. Water drops from the ceiling that you need to run a large dehumidifier running all the time. Your towels will always be damp no matter what. Your clothes and leather jackets will get white mildew spots on them.
Having to share a water meter with other apartments is nuts.
There are quite a few renters who  have no regard for others. They yell, scream & have parties well past 2am.
The garage has large raccoons that are in the garbage bin and during the day too. This makes it dangerous walking to your car not knowing if a rabid raccoon will attack you, or you can het bit while throwing trash away.
The maintenance people at times do not fix the problems.
The cost to rent here is not worth it.","San Francisco, CA",0,2,2,0
8/16/2010,Ale S.,-1,2.0,"We moved here when I was pregnant, so we thought it would be a nice place to raise a family, but we were so wrong. It's nothing but the pool that's suitable for a kid. THe weather is always horrible (crying for sun and warmth) even as compared to dtown SF. Hate the carpets, no playground within a walking distance (the one that belongs to the company is designed for some 10-12 years-old kids, always empty, dirty and dark). You can't avoid the shooting sounds coming from across the street. And yes a CAR is a must-have.","San Francisco, CA",0,8,N/A,0
1/2/2010,Dirk C.,-1,4.0,"What you see is what you get at Lakewood.  It's a very old building next to a shooting range.  I've lived in a lot of apartments and this one really isn't that bad.  The rent is cheap and the owner does not give rent increases to tenants who have been here the longest; some have been paying the same amount for the past 10-30 years.
Someone else mentioned asbestos.  Most apartments do have asbestos.  I moved to Lakewood from a brand new luxury apartment that had tons.  It's not really avoidable, so try not to be put off by that.  
As for size, the apartments range from very small to very large.  Almost every unit is completely different from one building to the next.  My one-bedroom is roughly 800sq feet, but I almost got stuck in one that was much smaller.  Wish I could've gotten the bigger one : )
I agree that the recent elevator problems suck, but that's the same for most apt. buildings.  I also agree that the laundry rooms were pretty awful, but  have recently been updated.   And some rooms are just nicer/cleaner than others.
I like being within walking distance to the beach and that the mall/grocery store is nearby.  I also like the fact the the gym has an actual locker room and there's an on-site dry cleaning business.   Management gets on my nerves sometimes, but they are much more flexible/helpful than most other property managers.
My biggest complaint about Lakewood is the narrow parking garage spaces.  After I get into my stall, I can't even open my passenger side door and if my neighbor parks too far over, it's hard to get out of the driver's side.  The shooting range kinda sucks, but if you work during the daytime, you won't notice much.  At night it's pretty quiet around here due to seclusion between the golf courses.  My unit is insanely quiet.  I almost never hear my neighbors, but I've heard that some units are very noisy and it probably depends on which building you live in.  They were all built at different times and some might be more soundproof than others.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

After an unfortunate break in of our car while we were across country from home - we lost many things of monetary and more importantly personal value.  Management found one the discarded bags on their property (that still contained things of value to us) and investigated the contents, found a phone number for my son's school - called the school and reunited us with what was left.

There are some conversations that I over heard between management that residents paying a pretty penny to live here should be subjected to hearing. I had a conversation with a young woman a couple weeks ago, Lena I want to say her name is, and she comes off very intitled and snobbish. I will not be addressing her in the future and I suggest you dont either. Also a gentleman by the name of Mark was just thee rudest, I attempted to talk about issue I was having and he must have interupted me 5 times and I was unable to get a word in. I gave up and walked away. Other then these 2 people my stay thus far has been well. I appreciate the roof top and dog wash.

4/28/2018,Ashton J.,-1,2.0,"The apartment community was great at first and as more tenants started moving in, it went from great to crap in a matter of months. A lot of 20-somethings in the building (who most likely share a 2 or 3-bedroom with 3 or 4 others) have no regard for other tenants and are often loud/obnoxious. The building has a strict ""no smoking"" policy (and this is clearly stated in the lease agreement) but we've seen people smoking (including marijuana) on the rooftop deck and on their patios on 1st floor. And the building staff/management have done nothing about it. On one particular occasion, some tenants smoked marijuana in an apartment, and a few folks got in to a heated argument which was reported by a neighbor and needless to say the cops showed up to address the situation. The entire floor was filled with smoke and smelled of marijuana! Some tenants basically treat the common space, especially the lounge on the second floor, as their living room. They hog the common space/amenities and basically hang out all day and all evening in the lounge preventing other tenants from being able to use this space.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

As of today she has made ZERO attempt to reconnect with me and answer my questions, even though she said ""I will get back to you"". It's been four days. You read reviews from tenants in which they outline how horrible this company is and while you hope those are isolated issues and give them a chance, only to be subjected to people like Koren Alexander. People like her, fuel the negative image for your company. I was told that many people have great experience with her. Perhaps, but imagine the countless other people she treated this way.

Updated review",Jessica P.,-1,1.0,"If you do make the terrible mistake of renting from them and inevitably run into an issue, call the main Greentree number and ask for Joy. (And when the receptionist says she's unavailable, say you'll wait on the line until she's free. She'll magically be available!). Joy removed the $800 charge shortly after getting involved in this issue (which overall took 2 weeks, daily phone calls, countless emails, and multiple reminders of my knowledge of the charge's violation of the California Civil Code to resolve).

Oh also -- forgot to mention that their ""renovations"" are only cosmetic. Yes, you'll be able to do laundry in your unit, but do you really want to hear your neighbors have normal volume conversations, sneeze, listen to classical music while working from home, or let's say...get to know each other better ;-) because Greentree is too cheap to insulate the walls?

I have never been annoyed with a company. We rented in Jan-May of 2017 on a month to month lease. Never heard a word from ANYONE until now, a year and a half later. I got a call from a collections service this morning saying we owed $2,600 and we were on our final notice before it effects our credit.

No phone calls, no letter, no emails- NOTHING on their end to let us know about this charge.

I have been trying to talk to someone all morning to find out why we were not notified for a YEAR AND A HALF, but I've been getting the run around. ""They will call you back"" ""we'll have an answer for you"" ""accounting department doesn't have a phone number""

To be clear, I am not complaining about owing money, it's their lack of communication and incompetence that has led me to write this review. We could have paid this off a year ago, instead I'm dealing with a collections agency.","Laguna Niguel, CA",391,5,1,0

Passing all fees to tenants and imposing inexcusable rent hikes. They will work their hardest to get every SINGLE dime they can out of you.

After making a short list of properties, we arranged a number of viewings and then made an application in the afternoon. A few days later the lease was signed by all parties. Overall this was very quick and easy. We did however have a few difficulties with the website, and had a technical error during the application process which took a few hours to resolve - causing some stress. For RentSFNow we'd give: 4/5

Mike Simpson was our letting agent and we strongly recommend him. He was professional yet laid-back, making for a good atmosphere for viewings. He was very attentive and responsive when we had questions regarding the  signing of the lease. Finally we feel he was very genuine and honest when answering our questions, giving us all the information we needed to find a place that worked well for us. Highly recommended! Rating for Mike Simpson: 5/5.

For example, I have been away from my apartment for an extended period of time and she has so kindly placed my mail and packages in my apartment.  She works outside hours to tend to emergency situations.  For instance, I had a leak in my sink pipe and upon reaching out, I heard back from her within 5 minutes and the technician came within 20 minutes.  We also had a plumbing/water problem in the building and she sent out an email in the evening notifying us about the water shut-off.

She is so hard-working, helpful, and dedicated to my happiness.  I want the best for her and recommend her for advancement in any position she aspires to be.  You can't teach kindness, empathy or warmth.  She already has that and she stands out.  I REALLY like her!","Newcastle, WA",0,2,N/A,0

4/19/2019,Mj Q.,-1,5.0,"First experience with RentSFNow. I was taking the shotgun approach on craigslist when I stumbled on a listing for a property being shown by Nolan Justus. Nolan showed me around that original place, then recommended another after asking more detailed questions about what I was after. That second property ended up being ideal; he was prompt in sending the application, guiding me through the process, and getting all involved parties to complete their steps as soon as possible. Within 48 hours we went from showing to approval to executed lease. When one considers how many other people and leads he's got to follow up on, that's impressive.

A few examples:  Dan met me on my arrival day in front of the building where he was holding a parking spot for me (in Hayes Valley there's NO place to park), making my move easy and fast.  Koren was my main point of contact, she always got back to me straight away, either answering questions or having someone on her team contact me to address any concerns I had.  I stayed at the apt for 5 months, a short-term furnished lease.  

It was a great choice of a place to stay, in a central area with my own laundry, all I had to bring were my clothes.  Rent included all utilities which made it very easy.

Shout outs to the team:

8/23/2016,Xavier D.,-1,5.0,"This review is specifically regarding agent Dean Smith. As a Florida resident, I accepted a position in the SF area which will keep me in SF for about 3 years. Before arriving to SF, I started searching for apartments and was surprised at how many fraud listings there were on other apartment sites. Until I ran across RentSF Now, the agents were pleasant to speak with and followed up with me on several listings. The agent at RentSF Now took all of my information and stated a Real Estate agent would call me back, and of course Dean Smith called me back. He was pleasant to speak with and informed me of the process and made arrangements for me to see several of the apartments I was interested in. Upon arriving in SF the following week, I met with Dean at the first location and he was pleasant, cordial and inviting. He took the time to show me the benefits and features of the apartment and never was insistent on closing a sale. On each and every apartment I saw that day, he performed marvelously and went out of his way to answer many questions I had. However, at the end of the appointment time/day, I was still not convinced on the units I saw. After discussing my reservations and my requirements, Dean told me he had two other apartments in mind that would probably fit my needs. He drove me across town and showed me a unit in the Castro and a unit close to Nob Hill, and BINGO the unit close to Nob Hill was the one.
It is the dedication of such agents like Dean Smith that makes a difference for any institution. Please extend a thank you to Dean Smith and pass along my KUDOS to him, Dean Smith is a stellar and experienced agent and I am glad to have met him.","New Port Richey, FL",0,3,N/A,0

She found us a BEAUTIFUL apartment that we can't wait to move in to and it gives us huge peace of mind to have that all set up already as we're packing up here in Michigan. Not only that, but she's been extremely responsive and helpful as we've had many questions about the steps we need to take before we move in. If you're able to, work with Inna!

Mari went out of her way to help me find the perfect place for me  and my husband.  She showed me an apartment and it was what I wanted but there was already a contract on it from another leasing agent.  Mari then found me the apartment I am in now and showed it to me the next morning at 9:00am. We were moved in within four days.  It was so expedient I would recommend her to anyone, anytime and with the utmost assurance that she will take care of them.

She processed my application the day I put it in and I took deposits to the main office and hours later we were approved.  She spent hours and hours answering my questions via text messaging and was prompt to answer each and every time.  She even took the time to listen to my life's moments and helped me get situated without batting an eye.  I actually got the keys the next day.  I did a walk through with management and we moved the next day.

David took tons of pictures and emailed them to me; I loved the apartment  and made my boyfriend go see it that night  to make sure everything was legit.

4/1/2014,Betty O.,-1,3.0,"I said that I would come back and update my review if Park-West Essex listened to my concerns. So the buildings are cleaner now, but unfortunately, I have a new negative feedback due to a problem that the management office has acknowledged is becoming a common complaint from multiple tenants: secondhand smoke.

The management office (Joseph and Shaniqe) ALLOWS smoking inside the apartments. So if your neighbor smokes, your whole apartment will be full of secondhand smoke. The management office keeps telling tenants who complain that there is a law in California that doesn't let them forbid smoking in the units. They say that they can forbid smoking in common areas only, however, that isn't the case either, since their own employee (Mike) smokes in the property. So to make the long story short: they do NOTHING about secondhand smoke coming into your apartment. These are old buildings, so even my remodeled apartment gets the secondhand smoke from my neighbors, along with their noise (no sound proof either; I could write pages about this too). I understand there is a law, but I also know that according to the San Francisco Apartment Association they can do a lot more than ignoring the complaints (especially since they are many): ""The San Francisco Rent Ordinance provides that a landlord may terminate a tenancy where ""[t]he tenant is committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in, or is causing substantial damage to, the rental unit, or is creating a substantial interference with the comfort, safety or enjoyment of the landlord or other tenants in the building, and the nature of such nuisance, damage or interference is specifically stated by the landlord in the writing as required by Section 37.9(c) (sfaa.org/january2013/130…).""  Also, it is their responsibility to inform the smokers that they must avoid secondhand smoke coming into my apartment: ""While smoking may be legal within the unit, it is the tenant's responsibility to prevent the migration of smoke from the unit to the common areas and other units. In letters to smoking tenants, you could suggest quitting or, alternatively, going outside to the street to engage in their habit (sfaa.org/january2013/130…)"". What about preventing smoking through the lease (nonsmoking addendum)? Forget it, they have no initiative at all. The comfort of their tenants is at the bottom of their list.

You might be asking yourself, so why is this person living there? Because I'm waiting for my lease to finish. I'm not planing to pay the one-month of rent early termination fee.

But since this location is really good, I'm putting 3 stars instead of 2 stars.","San Francisco, CA",82,22,6,0
4/7/2012,Julianne F.,-1,4.0,"I lived here during my last year at USF, and I really appreciate the friendliness of Martine and Katie, the landlord and managers. The grounds were well kept and the ammenities were great - especially as far as SF apartments go. The laundry rooms convenient and rarely overcrowded, the pool downstairs is something you never find elsewhere, the dog walk was regularly cleaned, the elevators are SO convenient and the maintenance team is quick to respond to any apartment issues. I also really appreciated their pet policy as they are less strict about breeds, but more strict about individual personalities of the animals. It's also right next to the 71 bus and a few blocks from the N-Judah, 28 and 29 buses. The location is right next to the main drag of Inner Sunset too, so a five minute walk can take you right to good bars and food :)

A few downsides are that, when apartments are being updated, sometimes you can get last-minute notice that maintenance or renovation teams will be working above you or possibly through your apartment. Also, if there are notices for water shut-off, they're placed downstairs in the mail area/lobby for our building, they're not always accurate or present - but I don't know how much of that is Park West's fault. Also, the prices are pretty high, but again, it's SF, so they're definitely not as high as most other apartment complexes.

Overall, I enjoyed living here and I recommend others to look into Park West.","El Cajon, CA",78,27,N/A,0

- You will live next to the highway - noisy, pollutant, etc

- The building makes a ton of noize between the hours of 4am - 6am moving multiple garbage dumpsters in and out of their garage multiple times a week. the noize woke us up every morning during the week

- they contract with a landscaping service that uses gas powered leaf blowers and mowers. the noise and carbon monoxide pollution are unbearable. Every Wednesday they are polluting the grounds right next to a children's playground. And their concierge on duty every Wednesday would not even speak to us about requesting that the landscaping service use more eco friendly equipment around small children. Think about that, they pay a service to pollute and make noize and dont care about their residents or their children.

- and the people who work the front desk are incredibly rude and unhelpful

Look at the message ""Jake F"" sent me, who claims I am a fake account, but if you perform a google search on his picture, you can tell it is his account and photo that is not real!!! As for, walking downstairs and speaking to someone, if Jake F was a real person or lived here, he would know that apt staff works 9-6 and only sec guards are downstairs after that, who do not know what is going on. Those of us who work during the day for a living cannot walk downstairs and talk to someone.

Shockingly bad neighbors and management.

Apparently one of our neighbors was so drunk they left their sink on for hours or days, which caused water filled with food to leak all over their unit.  And the apartment was so shoddily built, the water is leaking through 6 floors to affect units all over the complex, not only theirs.

One of my neighbors said there's a very real possibility many many units will become infested with mold as a result.

Guess what. There have been NO updates or notice from management about all this. They just want our water damaged and mold growing units to continue and force us to leave so they can raise prices.","San Francisco, CA",0,3,2,0

When my corporate place expired and the time came for me to move, I did move but loved the RC community so much that I stayed and moved downstairs to a different unit within the same complex. The staff is so welcoming and helpful and being new to the city safety was important for me and especially my family and there was never a time where we didn't feel completely safe and part of a broader community.

I could not recommend Rincon Green more highly. The front desk attendants are Always pleasant and very helpful and the leasing office managers (Allison and Janae in particular) are simply delightful. They regularly accommodated my requests to let vendors into my unit for furtniture deliveries, utility installs, etc. They even helped me sign up for a free year of high speed internet service through one of the providers the building has partnered with! They've always been responsive, informative and tuned in to the needs of the residents. The RC resident portal also offers very convenient ways to manage your account, communicate with other residents and just learn about the area.

I could not have asked for a better community to live in. It really eased my transition to SF and put my mind at ease overall.

- The staff is very professional and efficient. Whenever we needed service in the apartment, it was easy to put in a work order, and they would have it taken care of by the next business day. They are quick to answer any questions and are generally available.
- Great amenities from the gym to the free coffee/tea and package concierge.
- No noise problems in the apartment we were staying in (the west side of the complex).

- The premium rent is a bit of a con but somewhat expected for the location and type of apartment building. It is comparable to similar buildings.","San Francisco, CA",32,1,N/A,0

The location of property is excellent, walking distance to bart, muni stop or ferry building is about 15 mins walk, cal-train -20 mins walk.

The highlights of property are the hot tub at rooftop with amazing view of bay bridge and 24 hours onsite gym facility.

Despite of the studio we never felt it any small in size or even uncomfortable. The appliances (dishwasher, washer, dryer, microwave) were all good as new. If there was any service issue it was always resolved within a day.

Some of the things we particularly appreciated:
1. Location allowed us both to walk to work in SOMA and to the Ferry Building farmer's market on weekends. A Philz also opened up a block away to cover our coffee fix.
2. Staff was friendly and helpful with random questions, receiving packages etc. The few times we needed service work on our unit (light burned out) etc, they took care of things efficiently.
3. The on-site gym, while lacking a bit of the shiny new feeling, was really handy.

Some things to be aware of that were less appreciated:
1. Relatively speaking, you'll be paying a premium rent for the space.
2. We lived in two different units; our second unit, which was on the outer perimeter in back, could occasionally get noisy in the bedroom from bay bridge traffic. Definitely recommend living facing in the courtyard if possible.
3. Since the building is near several freeway ramps, traffic around rush hour can get crazy if you need to drive/uber/lyft around that time.

It may not be as flashy as the new developments in Rincon Hill that are popping up every week, but Venessa, Cameron, Joe and the rest of the staff really make up for it by providing incredible service to residents.

Rent is reasonable (by SF standards), emails are answered quickly (sometimes within minutes), service requests are completed promptly, and the property is very well managed. Units have new appliances, large windows, and ethernet ports in most rooms. The gym is huge, and is as nice as they come in this neighborhood. The rooftop is landscaped with succulents and has more than enough seating for you and your friends.

The only downsides are no fault of the staff or building. The San Francisco Bay Bridge is within 50 feet of the building, which means that noise and air pollution on this property are probably higher than in most other parts of the city. For this reason, it's hard to enjoy Emerald Park or the rooftop during times of heavy traffic (mornings and early evenings). That said, the apartments themselves are incredibly quiet and air circulation within the units is more than adequate on even the warmest days in this part of the city.

The biggest plus for me is Emerald Fund. Venessa and the management team are great to work with and I would definitely recommend this building to anyone looking for a convenient SF apartment.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

Rincon Green is like a beautiful sanctuary in the city with calm, serene green space & amazing amenities, including free yoga classes, balcony apartments, rooftop grills & a hot tub. The building is safe & always kept in immaculate condition from the lobby to the parking garage, rooftop entertainment area & fitness rooms.

The staff at Rincon Green all seem to love their jobs. They are extremely pleasant, courteous, helpful & genuinely interested in how you are doing. I've lived in 5 different states, and the management, leasing & maintenance staff are the best of any place I've lived. Everyone is top-notch, especially Sarah, Vennessa and Jairell (whom I truly appreciate for being kind enough to help carry my very heavy sofa when I was moving out).

Rincon Green is conveniently located near restaurants, food stores, shopping in Union Square, AT&T Park, BART, & so much more. It has a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge from the front gate, and it's perfect if you like to go for a walk, run or bike ride along the Embarcadero.

My actual apartment unit was wonderful, too. It was always quiet, and I loved my dishwasher, washing machine & dryer, quartz countertops and plenty of closet space. Plus, the leasing process was super simple. It was so quick and easy, I became a resident just 1 day after moving to the city with no leads on where I should live.

While 399 is a dog friendly community, the apartments are not built to withstand normal wear and tear caused by any size dog. The laminate floors dent and scratch very easily and UDR engages in practices that are designed to maximize move out expenses. Example - the ""eggshell"" paint is custom mixed for every apartment. As such, any small holes or touch up will require the entire wall to be painted - a single nail will require the entire wall. They will not provide touch up paint so if you plan to hang pictures, do not use nails. The bigger issue is the flooring. If you have slight scratches or marks on even a handful of planks, they will use this as cause to replace the laminate floors in the entire apartment. I'm posting this review to try to make people aware that as soon as you move out, UDR will do anything they can to take their pound of flesh.

To top it off, the response from UDR (property manager) that I would still have to put in a 30-day notice to leave the building is absurd at best, especially considering I'm a long time resident and have been sending in complaints about the smoking for a year. I've gotten to the point of sending in a complaint nearly every single day and the building does nothing to try to resolve. They barely follow up on any contact, calling the front desk results in ""thanks, we'll let management know"", and sending in service ticket just results in them being closed without a response.

Updated review",Kristen K.,-1,3.0,"UPDATE: my review went from 5-stars to 3-star.

The front desk is always kind, but service/maintenance and the management staff claim they will help but nothing has been resolved.

Here's why: I transferred to another unit during COVID and paid all the expensive fees to transfer. I even paid for a cleaning service to clean out my old place without any hassle. I was charged a huge fee afterwards to replace the flooring and for the walls. The walls should always be painted for every new resident, hanging picture is apart or normal wear and tear. Same thing goes for the floor. I kept the floor in good condition, I believe they just charged me an additional $500 for the floor to cover the cost of having a new better hardwood floor installed, which is a sneaky tactic. This was during COVID, so they must have been desperate for money to cover this, which they shouldn't be, my rent was $4,000 for a studio.

Now moving onto the unsatisfactory reasons of the new unit I moved into. For one dryer is very loud. It squeaks every time I use it. My dishwasher has an error code on it after EVERY single use. My neighbors smell potent. One neighbor smokes cigarettes and marijuana, it's so strong that it irritates my sinuses and allergies. Another or may be the same or both cook very strong smelling food with spices. I get the two-to-three smells flowing into my apartment from the vents and it's very unsettling.

Not to mention when I moved in here, my washer and dryer were filthy. Especially my washer. I requested for a new washer and dryer but haven't gotten it yet. I have alerted management a handful of times, and nothing.

The service doesn't communicate with you about when they will arrive. In the service requests I say call or text me before hand - they never done, they came once when I requested for them to fix the dryer but it was at a bad time so I told them to come back. They said they would come back that day at 3:30pm. They never showed up, this or similar events actually have happened more than once with service. They seem to really be slacking off. So I'm unhappy with that.

I can't seem to get any help with my issues and it's disturbing. This place is not luxury. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I like my view, the safety and the amenities.","San Francisco, CA",282,24,24,0

3/8/2020,Lisa M.,-1,5.0,"This is an amazing building. I am a brand-new resident and I would like the world to know about two very exceptional leasing agents who have made my experience first-rate.

I first met with Jessica for my tour instructions. She was very friendly, so personable, and really took the time to explain every single feature I would be viewing. During my self-guided tour, I thought the door of an empty unit was locked. So I texted Jessica and she came up to the floor right away. That's right - here you can actually text the agents.

Jessica had a hunch that I would fall in love with a certain unit, and she was right. Once again, she did an excellent job in helping me sort through all of the questions, details and due dates. She even arranged to reserve a certain elevator for as long as we needed, so that my movers could go back and forth with ease, saving me time and expense.

I think she really cares about the residents and it certainly shows.

After I moved in, I was unpacking on a Saturday evening and had a user-issue (yes that's me) with one of the appliances. It started beeping non-stop and I didn't know what to do. I took a chance that the office might still be open and went down to the 2nd floor. Jimiyo was downstairs in the lobby, about to leave the building. He looked up and asked if I needed help.

When I explained my dilemma, Jimiyo said that he would not only assist, but that he would come up and show me. I was floored. He was done with his day and he didn't have to help me in person, but he did.

He not only showed me how to fix the issue, but made sure I knew how to work the appliance and its features, so that I could use it on my own with confidence.

I am very happy with this building, my new apartment and the amazing service I've experienced with both Jessica and Jimiyo. I feel very lucky indeed and highly recommend living here.","San Francisco, CA",0,2,N/A,0

We moved into our beautiful new home at 399 Fremont a few days ago, and are absolutely loving it here!

Jimiyo, our fantastic leasing agent, was always and continues to be there for us, going out of his way and doing all that he possibly can to answer all our questions and help out with minor issues that we found after moving in, making sure they were addressed immediately and to our full satisfaction.

Touring the property with Jimiyo was absolutely fantastic, as he explained everything in great detail, with a level of passion, enthusiasm and detailed knowledge that we'd never seen anywhere else while touring over 10 properties in total here in the city. He pointed out all the wonderful highlights of the building as well as every apartment that we looked at, and gave us all the time we needed to look around, ask questions, check availabilities and so on, it simply could not have been any better.

We are also super happy with our new home here, the apartment is absolutely outstanding, the staff and concierge are super friendly and it is a truly wonderful community overall.

Also, the apartment appears to be very well isolated, as we haven't heard any noise from outside or from our neighbors whatsoever.

If you're looking for a new home, I very strongly recommend 399 Fremont.","San Francisco, CA",0,2,N/A,0

Updated review",James J.,-1,5.0,"We've lived here three years and this is our experience:

- Maintenance team are great, quick to respond and job done well. Shout out to Josh and Dave.

- Leasing team are nice, shout out to Alanna who does her best to try and help accommodate our asks/needs.

- At reception the team are lovely, always greeting us with a smile and always somehow in a good mood! Shout out to Crystal and Jezza.

To respond to other folks unnecessarily marking low stars:

*Food smells - do not travel from my experience. Replace air filters every 6 months to avoid this.

*Elevators - We have 3 that service all floors, and an additional 2 that service -1 to 8.  Schindler's own/operate the lift as a service. Over the 3 years here I've had max 7-10 days disrupted total due to elevators down seems like a pretty good overall service to me.

*Rent increase - are commonplace and mine were very reasonable, and inline with my expectations.","San Francisco, CA",45,5,10,0
9/7/2019,Theaura K.,-1,5.0,"I moved into this building in April, 2019. I immediately fell in love with the floor plan, the bay view, the city view, the apartment features, and the friendly courteous professional staff from Day 1.  The new resident services manager, Lorri, who started about 2 months before I moved in is such a wonderful professional courteous helpful person who would not hesitate to personally assist you with locating a missing package or helping you gain access back to your apartment after leaving your key in there. Lorri would maintain a delightful pleasant demeanor and courteous tone no matter how hectic things got around here at the front desk.  I find her even more helpful than the members of the actual Concierge team.   Sr. Assistant Community Director, Delainey, was super friendly and helpful with my move-in.  I showed up without an appointment to tour the apartment after almost signing a lease with the building across the street, and Delainey took the time to personally show me around, and I made the decision to move in afterwards.  The maintenance engineer, Dave, is such a delightful person to deal with.  Positive friendly attitude, courteous prompt assistance as always.  I very much enjoy living here because of the management and maintenance team.  I moved here from Washington DC in April, and 399 welcomed me warmly.  Thank you!","San Francisco, CA",0,1,4,0

Outdoor pool and spa with killer gym 3.) the staff is cool, fun, and always on top of things 4.) little touches like new pool table, book club, and fresh cookies/flowers/goodies all around 5.) best rooftop and lounge areas 6.) awesome offices on demand at no cost 7.) being high on the hill and away from lots of new buildings there's plenty of wonderful views.

I had stopped by at least 3 different times throughout the month of May to show some of my family and friends and each time, they were very accommodating. They allowed us on the 5th floor and were warm and welcoming to all the guests. Delainey was a huge asset and was extremely helpful and attentive throughout the entire process. She is thorough, responsive and eager to make sure your event is absolutely perfect. We were allowed to bring our own decorations, alcohol and food which was great. I loved that the kitchen was hidden in the back but there is a gorgeous island in the middle of the venue where friends can gather, drink and eat.

3/25/2018,Joshua W.,-1,5.0,"399 Fremont is easily my favorite place to live in SF after ~13 years in towers and luxury buildings in SF.

Tldr; I stayed in 399 as a weekend guest of a friend during a year I was traveling, and liked staying here enough to move into an apartment here 3 months later.  If you like clean, modern, convenient, and things like high speed 1gig internet, it's been 4 months for me and I keep finding new things to love about this home:)

Background and detail:
When I first started visiting, I was struck by the friendly and welcoming community of residents AND staff.  After the first weekend I spent here, I walked away feeling like I'd made some friends and that the concierge desk had made the effort to learn my name and story and proactively help me... even though I was only in town for a weekend.

Flash forward through 3 months of visiting this building and quite a few others when in town for work (I was lucky enough to have friends in many of the nearby ""similar complexes"") and I can state with a great deal of confidence: ** 399 is the best luxury building in San Francisco. **

I truly enjoy all of the beautiful amenities the building has to offer.  It's great to live in a place that your friends ask if they can come over and hang on a regular basis:)

It wouldn't feel like the home we have here without the wonderful management team and staff. Kristie and her team always go above and beyond to take care of anything that may come up (feel free to message me if you want a reference or examples).

They truly make this place feel like a community.

If you're looking into moving, and are looking for the best, definitely pay 399 a visit, take a quick tour, and make a friend or two:).  

(Note, I wasn't offered any special treatment for making this post and I've lived 4+ months in this apartment. If anything, I just want to make sure the staff gets credit for the hard work they put in to make this a great place to live:)","South of Market, San Francisco, CA",531,2,N/A,0

Can't speak enough good words about Lawrence and Stanley, and the rest of the amazing crew who makes our lives easier and more pleasant! They are always super helpful, understanding and responsive.

The apartments are very stylishly designed, super sleek and neat, and we had never had any problems with anything being broken and not fixed: we had to fix the icing machine in the fridge once, and the building service team was on it the next day - very efficient and quick!

Lastly, we love our neighbors: it is a very close friendly community of young professionals and really interesting people, and it is great to socialize together at pool parties, fireplace wine nights or rainy day BBQs.

Oh, and the elevators are SO FAST. The rooms are really quiet when you close all the windows, even when people have loud cars, construction, you name it.

The neighborhood is wonderful, kind of stuck right between everything. Within a 15 minute walk of so much stuff. I have not been able to explore much with covid but the location is awesome.

The units themselves look great and all of the finishes are high quality. The walls and ceilings are solid & the windows are very insulated -- I never hear my neighbors and rarely hear noise from the street.

The amenities are great -- dog park, underground parking, dog grooming area, building gym, pool, hot tub, co-working space with conference rooms, private park, and more! Very dog friendly, too! Looking forward to the Equinox opening up soon as well.

Not a ton of stuff in the very immediate neighborhood, but a short walk to Hayes Valley or the Mission for bars and restaurants. And a Whole Foods, Safeway, and upscale market (Market on Market) all within a few blocks.

Everyday things like receiving packages and food/grocery delivery is very smooth.

I love how friendly the staff are...some of them feel like family because they're always looking out for us and always so fun to catch up with. If you're lucky, you'll be greeted by Joe or Shannon who are my absolute favorite guys. They really make this place feel like home!","San Francisco, CA",0,2,6,0
3/2/2021,Jordan B.,-1,5.0,"...There's no place like home, and I've never lived anywhere like FifteenFifty.

Pool and hot tub? Check?
19inch deep tubs in the bathrooms? Check. Appliances camouflaged to look like cabinets? Check.
Neat little workstation with automatic coffee maker so you can work from home without feeling trapped in your apartment because the entire world is on pandemic lockdown and your office has to be vacated? Check.
Friendly staff to greet you when you get home? Check.

We moved in before most of the amenities were available after a tour from Jason Sypult, who is among the more lovely humans you are likely to meet in SF. I'd say that means we got less of an experience of living here, but the quality of our living space is so high that we were able to find ways to treat living here like being on a cruise ship. YouTube Yoga in the living room? You bet. Yoga in the park (did you know there's a park ""in"" the building?) and yoga in one of the empty Penthouses absolutely happened. When we could have folks visit (when CoViD tiers allowed), we made sure to take them to the penthouse club and deck because the views are spectacular.

Being able to just walk into Hayes Valley or the Mission from here to enjoy the closed street days has been a godsend (like shore leave at a port). Parking in the protected garage below the building has been super easy, and this location makes getting to the highway or up to market street to get to the western and northern parts of the city super easy. Valet service in the garage is something I didn't know I wanted before I moved in.

At ground level, SF is SF. You will occasionally run into stuff that isn't safe or savory when you walk out the doors. That said, you have to walk outside to look up at this building to see how gorgeous it is. Nothing else in the city looks like FifteenFifty, and catching the angles off of it an sunset is a treat. If you don't spend any time at ground level, you won't get a chance to interact with the stellar concierge staff, who are among the most valuable aspects of living here. Also, it's SF, if you're here, then you're used to it by now.

Take a tour, see it for yourself. Or just drive up South Van Ness and gawk at it (we've watched people park to take pictures). Either way, great place to live.","San Francisco, CA",199,19,15,0

As a Nurse, my home is my sanctuary and I value every last square foot of it. I have been living in Alchemy since November 2016 and seen the transition of ownership from Alta to Holland. I have come to know each individual in the leasing office and feel like they each know who I am and what my needs are. With Holland's takeover, the close-knit community thrives with social get-togethers and a strong sense of peace, unity and respect. This community welcomes all new incomers openly and respectfully. Within the grounds, there's a subset of happy dogs and owners in this pet-friendly environment that frequently play and socialize, along with some community dog walkers! Holland maintains a healthy and respectable set of rules that accommodate all those pet-friendly/not. There's so much that Holland and this community has to offer. If you're interested in knowing more, stop by the leasing office and ask for Jenna. Jenna is one of the best ""community caretakers"" that this community has to offer.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

12/2/2009,David C.,-1,1.0,"I was employed by the Monroe Residence Club for about 6 months from last October, through April.  I am a full time student, and had recently lost my job, and couldn't afford rent.  A friend of mine had recently been employed on a worktrade system, and it was a more appealing option than couchsurfing while i looked for work.

From a ""caring about those who care for you"" point of view.  They make the majority of their employees stay in ""sub levels.""  They are in tiny, shared, mold filled rooms, that have the tendency to make everyone sick.  They started remodeling the rooms just as I was leaving, so they could be a little better now.

They pay their staff minimum wage, and incredibly inflexible about work schedules, the employees arent allowed to use the kitchen, and they have to have overnight guests pre-approved. Not to  mention they are abusive to their employees.  I was fired when the general manager, James, came into the Kitchen, where I worked, screaming at us and slamming doors, for nothing, and I told him it wasnt ok for him to talk to us like that.

There also was rampant drug and alcohol problems amongst the employees while i worked there.  Im not talking about smoking some weed or getting wasted on the weekends either.

Then from a resident's point of view.
The kitchen is GROSS!  The dressing, butter, etc, from the salad bar, and tables, gets scraped back out, and put in the fridge for the next meal.  Its often mixed with spilled salad, crumbs, people caugh germs, you name it.  The floor gets hosed down, but never scrubbed.  Meat that doesnt get served gets put in the fridge to be reworked into another dish, sometimes over a week later.

The food quality is the lowest end of sysco style catering food.  most people develop digestive problems while they are there.

And they clean their soft serve icecream machine with a cleaner that is labeled as TOXIC!

The cost is outrageous for what you receive.  Housing prices in SF are high, but with some hunting you can find a place for 600 bucks, with your own room, a kitchen that you can use, sane neighbors, and you get to feed yourself real food.

I can  not discourage people from staying here enough.  San Francisco is a much cooler city than this residence hotel gives the impression of.  Polk street is not a ""cool"" neighborhood to hang out in, and its not so cool for college aged students to be shushed in the lobby.","Oakland, CA",0,1,N/A,0

Where to start. First the manager is a paranoid little man who needs to be in complete charge of everything. BEWARE he also has had sixteen sexual harassment suits against him and the hotel in the past several  years.
The rooms are OK but the food sucks for the price. The WI_FI they offer is a joke. This is run like a college dorm with guests having to sign a register and there are no quests after 10:00 pm ..
If you are looking for a place to stay I'd choose a nice bed and breakfast rather than this dump.

12/13/2018,Doug K.,-1,3.0,"In 1968 I was a new computer salesman - a ""missionary salesman"" they called it - for the RCA Corporation, covering the banks of San Francisco.  After finishing training in Cherry Hill NJ, I boarded a United Air Lines 707 in New York City and landed in San Francisco.  My office was in the financial district, and another salesman suggested that I check out the ""Monroe Club"" on Sacramento St. near Van Ness Avenue.  I did so and took the big private room on the second floor just above the cozy lobby with the fireplace and the elevator.  Private bath, phone, double bed, big three window bay window overlooking Sacramento St.  Not much closet space. Noisy at night.  I think I paid $220/month.  Walked to work on clear days, on rainy days (there were many of them) I took the cable car a block away down California St. I stayed at the Monroe Club for about 18 months; compared to the Marine Barracks of my recent experience it was ok; but not as clean. Food about the same.  RCA was constantly sending me back to Cherry Hill for more training, so I would check out,  leave for two or three months on the East Coast, come back to SF and get in line for the ""nice rooms"",staying in whatever ""single room/shared bath"" that was available.  On one of these ventures I go a really low class single room w/shared bath, about halfway down the long hall on the second floor.  I think that I was in that room for two or three weeks - until my favorite room opened up.  One afternoon I came home to find my window missing (!)  The entire frame was gone!  A pidgeon was perched on the window sill checking out my possessions. (This was in November; a chill wind was blowing!)  I called management at the front desk, and was informed that the handyman (Mr. Mulaney) had taken the broken frame to the repair shop and would be back with a new window ""shortly"".  I went out for dinner and drinks, came back at 11:00 pm to find no change in the window situation.  I went to bed; all night the cold San Francisco fog billowed around me, all night I was troubled by the meloncholy ""woooooop!"" ""wooooop!"" of the foghorn on Alcatraz island in the bay - probably the worst night I had spent since those in the jungles of Vietnam.  The next day management informed me that Mr. Mulaney had been given cash to pay the repair shop for the new window, and had siezed the opportunity to have a few drinks at the Club's expense.  He left my window in some bar somewhere in Oakland; it was never found again.  The Club replace Mulaney and my window in a day or two and gave me a refund on the rent.

During this month, I shared my bedroom with another women and we had to share the showers with the all floor. I think the Monroe it's a good residence for all the European going to San Francisco. You meet there a lot of young people going from a large part of the world.
I agree the room wasn't perfectly clean everyday but it's never seem dirty to me. The room was very small and it was sometimes difficult to find a place to put our bag.
The situation is perfect for me, more or less 15 minutes by walk to Market Street or a bus stop just near the residence; 10 minutes by walk to the fisherman Wharf or also a bus. Near a big supermarket and a post office.

The management is very uncompassionate about the issues around their lack of security. Desiree and Amy are very unhelpful with resolving issues. You have to pay for sewer, water, and garbage. There are plenty of lofts in this area and I highly recommend living at another.

I would like to follow up to Amy's comment because there are lies within the response. You did not work with me on the parking situation. My parking permit was stolen from your mailboxes that were broken into inside the building. I spoke with SFMTA today and they are issuing me a new one. You are not allowing me to park in the garage while I await my new parking permit.

You never gave me a new key when you gave me one that does not work, even though I put in a request for it.

You also were not upfront about how much utilities cost. Desiree told me utilities cost less than they did. When I questioned her about it she told me she quoted me what it would cost for one person, when my application had always been for 2 people. She also overcharged my move in fee.

Pros- Building is clean and units are well maintained.
- staff is great
-Maintenance is on top of it
-Units block sound

Cons- RENT PRICES BEWARE! I have been here 2 years. First year, fair, second year 10% max increase. 3rd year COVID, 3% reduction offer with 6 weeks free rent. NOW, unit next door that is larger and renovated is for rent 17% less than mine and 8 weeks free rent, so loyal tenants get the middle finger.
- Homeless is insane and screaming daily outside, with shelter around the corner.
- NEW BUILDING BEING BUILT. This is directly across the street. 12 stories and 2 years of construction. Good luck on sleep with jackhammers and trucks blocking road for development. They will not tell you this.
- Neighbors are not friendly. Maybe it is an SF thing, but I have only made friends with 1 neighbor in 2 years and all others do not talk to you, close elevator before you get in, walk by and stare at ground without saying hello. Totally disconnected from reality and lack of social skills.
-Human feces on street. This is no joke. Take a drive around the block and you will see your friendly neighbors.

Anyhow... My move in date got moved back three times because they kept saying the apartment just couldn't be ready by then.  I had already rented a truck and had to take it back the day after my first scheduled move in date.  

She called me and asked if I could send in my deposit. Since I was on the road it was easier for me to get on their rent payment website, which charges $35 to make a payment through there. But then a few days later she called and said she made a mistake so I actually owed $480 more.

Natalya, said we could have a room with a view of the ocean, I thought ahh how nice will that be to watch the sunsets. Well I got there to sign the lease and it was nothing but a view of the other building's balconies.

I blew all that off cause I was sick of hotel rooms and just wanted to get my stuff unpacked and unwind, so I signed the lease.  Something came up the day after the lease signing and I was not going to be able to stay  there. I thought... oh no big deal I read about a 30 day guarantee in the lease agreement. So when I called about it I wanted to deal with someone that knew what was going on so I asked for the property manager, Dave.  Dave said, ""the way the lease is worded we do not have to let you terminate the lease. It is at our discretion.""  And then something like he could hold me to the full years lease legally. So they are keeping my $1999 deposit, and I have never been inside of the actual apartment, and the lease was not to start until the day after I terminated my lease.

They do get one star for the convenience. But from what I saw on the tour of the building, it was nothing special and nothing I would call nice. Why not just rent a house for about the same amount, not have to haul my crap 5 stories into the air, enjoy my privacy, with a real ocean view, and live in a little more clean setting.","San Francisco, CA",0,3,N/A,0
8/16/2013,Melina G.,-1,3.0,"The staff are really friendly even though I'm sure they must be getting sick of accepting all my online purchases and delivering them to my apartment (a perk which I am loving), my apartment is huge for a 1-bedroom with an unbeatable floor plan and floor to ceiling windows and the location is brilliant. I catch the light rail to work or walk into downtown and both are very quick and convenient. Not to mention Downtown  is gorgeous on the weekend and there is a supermarket down the street.The apartment complex itself is like living in a hotel. The amenities are brilliant and it seems underutilized so you can almost always enjoy them whenever you feel like it. Yes, it would be great if the lounge etc (which has free wi-fi!) was open 24/7 like the gym but that's just being fussy. The regular community events are great too - an excellent way to get to know your neighbours and something which I really value since I'm new to the area. My apartment faces the street but the noise doesn't bother me in the slightest. I guess if you were sensitive to noise perhaps you would prefer a pool-facing apartment but I really enjoy the sunlight from the outside.Overall, I am very happy living at Avalon.

The laundry facilities onsite are wonderful and parking is great for having friends come over.  The location is really nice.

The building is next to Mt. Sutro Open Space.. Being next to the mountain makes it very quiet. If you're on the mountain side you can see hawks flying. The building was built in the 60s so it doesn't have all the amenities of newer complexes, but the architecture is sound and Avalon has done a great job of maintaining it. They recently went through major remodeling work, which was very noisy. But that is over. They do convert older apartments as they become vacant so there is occasional noise, but not like before as some reviews mention.

There is NO white powder in the hallways! I think Mr. H is a bored person with nothing to do but malign a good company and good people.  I was outside about 2 weeks ago walking my dog, as I was making my way to the main entrance, I notice Mr. H was also walking his dog but his dog was not on a leash.  The manager asked him politely to put his dog on a leash and Mr. H lashed out in a very vulgar manner.  Then he yelled at the manager that he would see him in court?  For what? Seriously, he's going to sue Avalon because he was told to put his dog on a leash which is a city regulation when you are outside?  Mr. H. if you have lung cancer you probably gave it to yourself because you did not get it from here!

Yes, Sunset Towers is currently under construction.  They are making the building inside and out more beautiful and better - what more could a resident want?  We are told in a timely manner what they will be doing and for how long.  Management is always willing to help.  They are considerate and kind.  If anyone is unhappy, then just move out!

Construction will be noisy, will create traffic, and the management has been keeping this quiet while aggressively encouraging people to renew their leases early before they realize this is about to happen.

Updated review",Colin D.,-1,1.0,"Overall, our year stay at 2000 Post was horrible. We had issues throughout the year which we spoke to building management about several times, and none of these issues were ever resolved. The amount that we had to pay per month for what we put up with is ridiculous. The only good thing about this terrible place was Chris the maintenance guy.

To start, our move out process was horrible. When we had our move out inspection, they told us we would be charged huge amounts of money to have our place cleaned. This is ridiculous. Throughout our stay there have been construction workers in and out, dust throughout the halls and air, etc which directly affected the cleanliness of our apartment. We have kept it clean to the best we could with normal wear and tear and should absolutely not be charged this amount, especially when much of the dust and dirt is from construction.

At one point during our time here, there were issues with the sewage in our building, resulting in both our sink and toilet exploding with sewage water all over our bathroom and into our kitchen. While they did clean it up, at no point was our unit steam cleaned or professionally cleaned. Why should I have to pay over $300 when this standard was not even provided for me when I lived there?

Besides that, there have been broken elevators, mice,etc. One of the worst was at one point there were squatters in an apartment cooking drugs!!!!!!!! This has been by far the worst place I have ever lived. If I were you, I would avoid at all costs!","San Francisco, CA",0,3,N/A,0
4/15/2011,Kevin L.,-1,1.0,"The building itself is fine.  The people were for the most part nice.  However, you should expect the smell of cigarettes to come through your bathroom air vent, frequent fire alarms, frequent malfunctioning laundry rooms, ridiculous cleaning fees when you move out and clans of bums loitering around the building.  

I put up with it the entire time I was living here and probably wouldn't be writing this review if the management would have handled my final move-out bill a little better.  Long story short, they forgot to send it to my new address.  When I emailed to inquire about the amount, they sent me an email and told me to send a check in 15 days.  12 days later, with my check in the mailbox, I got a call from a credit collector saying I needed to electronically transfer money immediately or I would have a ding on my credit.  So far, I've spent 30 minutes on the phone with a credit collector trying to ensure that the $250 I owe for my final move-out doesn't screw up my credit.  The fact that I'm even dealing with this is absolutely absurd and completely irresponsible by the 2000 Post Management.  

I wouldn't have any faith that they'll make sure you're taken care of.  Consider yourself warned.","San Francisco, CA",158,9,2,0

She's pleasant when trying to sell you something, but the moment you have a question, something doesn't work right or the building has an issue, she'll be the first to turn her back and blame you for it. They have absolutely no intent to keep residents happy or satisfied. No value for the money either.

This place is dingy. Don't let the pictures fool you. Inside, apartments are sprayed with a thin layer of paint and stink of cigarettes. Mine was even recarpeted and painted before I moved in. One of the worst decisions I've ever made! Save your money or spend the same elsewhere for a far better deal.

Nice Pool/ decent gym
Good Location
Friendly Staff - on the surface

Cons:

-Stupidly overpriced
-No utilities at all are included
-Terrible unbelievably slow elevators
-Overpriced parking
-Unbelievably loud fire alarms that go off regularly in the middle of the night. In my 13 LONG months there I was rattled out of my sleep at least 3/4 times, with another 2/3 times during waking hours.
- If you're on the outside face of the building, the noise from Geary and the sports fields is considerable. Every Saturday and Sunday be ready to hear whistles and cheering and screaming all day long.
- They make you sign a 13 month lease and will screw you for every penny of it. I had to give my 30 day notice (if you go month-to-month your rate skyrockets upward by roughly $500/mo) and found a new place that required me to move in a couple weeks before my move out date of March 8th. I had the entire apartment steam cleaned and empty prior to March 1st with keys turned in, yet they still forced me to pay rent for those 8 days and were extremely obnoxious about it.

When I arrived at lunch time I was greeted by a young lady named Julie who answered all my questions willingly with a smile on her face until Daniel returned from his previous tour. Once Daniel arrived I introduced myself and he was so polite and welcoming. Which is a big deal to me. We went on our tour and he showed me the whole property from the gym and pool all the way to the other courtyard. He was great. If it was up to me I would have signed a lease that day but THANK GOODNESS I DIDN;T! I wanted to wait and go see some other properties and then come back. The day I came back neither Julie or Daniel were available to tour so unfortunately I had to get my tour with the manager. You would think this would be a positive thing until you meet her. The tour she gave was extremely lousy and horrible, so unfriendly and I felt as if she was lying to every question I asked and answering it according to some stupid corporate guidelines. She was very rude and rushed the whole tour!  WHAT KIND OF MANAGER IS THIS? I can not believe this beautiful property is managed by a person with such horrible hygeine and a horrible attitude. Sorry Daniel you can blame your manager for the reason I didn't rent..I gave the two stars because of the horrible manager and how she made me feel.

My favorite times in the city are cool early evenings when we can grill outside together with a few of the neighbors, and play some pool in the community room afterwards.

And there a plenty of accessible ways to get around, which is important to me.  I don't like being in a wheelchair to be a reason I can't see my son.  Instead, because of the people and facilities at 2000 Post, I have reason to look forward to it.

The (almost completed) construction has definitely been a hassle, but we're still here, and that should tell you something.  Other than the questionable colors of the paint job on the exterior of the building, all of the new stuff (hot tub, gym, pool area, grills, lounge) is really high quality and was worth the noise.  We'll likely be here for another couple of years, high rent and all, because it's San Francisco and anything much cheaper is either really remote or a complete dump.

I'd also like to compliment the staff for the the way they've taken care of me, my wife, and my highly needy dog.  Danielle, Gunther, Idi and Cayla have been unfailingly nice to us, even when we have occasionally bent the rules a little.  Maintenance has almost always been timely as well.  We've lived in three separate units in the building, and move in and move out has always gone smoothly.

I'll add this -- I completely understand the one and two star ratings from folks that spent the majority of their time here during the construction process, which has lasted a full year at this point.  That said, it's basically over now, and I think every last thing is likely to be done by the beginning of June.  If you can afford the pricey apartments, you're really going to like it here now that everything is completed.

EDIT:  It's now September of 2016, and everything about the renovation has long since been completed.

So glad that we followed our instinct!! This property has been absolutely fantastic from the moment we began our tour with Gunther.

First and foremost, Gunther is probably one of the nicest staff members I have ever worked with. He is not only professional and knowledgeable, but his interaction with you is more like a friend and very personable. His service is impeccable but even more importantly he wants to help you in every way possible. It is a trait that is refreshing and deserves recognition and mention ;-) Thank you Gunther for everything!!!

Not to mention, his interaction with your pets is so cute and caring.

We knew within the first 5 minutes of the tour that this was going to be our residence of choice.

The amenities that are included, set this property apart by long strides. When you consider the amount for rent and what you get with it, there is simply no comparison. From multiple multiple laundry rooms, pool, spa, fitness center, landscaped gardens, grill areas, front concierge, package delivery and more this property sets itself apart from the rest.

Without needing to be said, we chose this property for our residence.

From the moment we showed up with our moving truck, we were once again welcomed by Gunther right out front and we did our walk through. He took his time with us and was literally excited that we have arrived at our new home. He was just as happy as we were, and you could tell that he really cared.

Anything we needed touched up, which was practically nothing, was taken care of immediately.

Which brings me to maintenance. This maintenance staff is simply unbelievable and remarkable. I have lived in several communities and this team is what all maintenance crews in all properties should model themselves after. When you need something done, they are right there to do it, within a very fast manner, and happily. That speaks monumentally.

Chris in particular is who we have worked with and his service is 100% fantastic. He takes pride in his work and already knew our name to say hello when he arrived. He goes above and beyond in every situation and always wants to make you sure you have everything you need taken care of. Wow!! The professionalism of this staff is superb.

Overall the office staff, maintenance staff, beautiful apartments, surrounding area of parks, shopping, grocery, entertainment, restaurants, etc. is something that most would desire. The pacific heights area in general is one heck of nice area and has everything that you need or could want and getting to any other area of the city is a breeze ;-)

Would highly recommend this property to anyone.

Looking forward to living in this wonderful community ;-)

Also, the maintenance staff is the best I've  ever seen, especially Chris who is amazing (I've never seen anyone work so hard to make sure everything is fixed and working the way it's supposed to work)!","San Francisco, CA",0,2,N/A,0
1/8/2015,Jose L.,-1,5.0,"I have lived at 2000 Post for over 1 year. My overall living experience has been amazing. The Community Director Hyes is a great manager. She is on top of her game. The property is going through renovations right now and I am very impressed of how Hyes has been able to plan the logistics of this renovation in a very safe and organized manner. In only three months of renovation work, the community is looking fresh and inviting. 2000 Post also has a great maintenance team. It takes them less than 10 hours to respond to any maintenance concerns I may have. Furthermore the Office Team has always a positive attitude and they will go the extra mile to make sure you are a happy tenant. If you are looking for an apartment to live, 2000 Post is not your place. But, if you are looking for a community where you can call home, then 2000 Post is the perfect fit for you.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

Elizabeth, Ida, Gunther, Hyes and Danielle are so nice and very helpful and friendly.  We appreciate them all so much.  The maintenance crew is awesome, Maria, Ricardo,  Chris Carroll are especially wonderful.  There are some names I am leaving out right now  because I can't remember, but I want them to know that I know what hard workers they are, and they always have a smile and are so willing to help.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0
3/27/2009,Teresa B.,-1,5.0,"I lived at 2000 Post for a year only to move to another property owned by the same company because it is closer to my job. I loved living at 2000 Post, it is ideally located to many things in the heart of the Fillmore District and I would look forward to my weekends wondering around Fillmore. The property has everything I could want; a pool, gym, parking, washer and dryers and a wonderful staff. They were very helpful during my move and it made it a very easy transition for me!","San Francisco, CA",0,2,N/A,0
3/24/2009,Kate G.,-1,5.0,"I highly recommend 2000 Post, it is very convenient to many great places in San Francisco. Within walking distance to Fillmore Street, restaurants and the grocery store. The assigned parking, washer and dryer, pool, gym and did I mention guest parking are absolutely great. Where in the city can you not only find a place to park for yourself but also for your guests??","San Francisco, CA",0,2,N/A,0
1/20/2010,Peter C.,-1,4.0,"I found this weekly rental just start from $490 in this good location.
(UCSF/COLE Valley/Haight ashbury/Downtown).  This is a hotel apartment style building.

Frist, I stay for a week and then I love to stay there for another week. The room with internet/TV/sink which is  very comfortable and plus large window with Sunny sunset view/fresh air.  They provide daily cleaning in all common areas.

I enjoy to use their large eat in kitchen areas and sunny sitting room.  

Job, project and rotation or new to city  and try to settle down or relocate to find ideal place.

Everything here is just in 5-10 minutes walking distance.  

Two way public transportation in fornt the building take you to downtown and ocean beach/goldern gate bridge in just 15-20 minutes.  Quiet building under good management.  The operator provide good services.
