9/10/2018,B C.,-1,1.0,These people are thieves and con artists.  Do not give them any information because they will steal from you.  Please look elsewhere because you will eventually regret even considering this place.  The staff is atrocious and highly trained in harassment.  DO NOT LET THEM TRICK YOU INTO FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION.  They believe it is the same thing as signing a lease.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",0,28,N/A,0

Updated review",Brian L.,-1,1.0,"Just classic. I came back to yelp to see if there was a response to my review. Of course in classic smoke and mirrors style these guys took down my poor review which reads below. That is the biggest problem with these guys. They are not transparent at all and they only want to let you know about the positives and ignore the negatives. Its quite appalling that they took the review down but not surprising given their MO. Yelp is not supposed to be a cherry picking of only good reviews for the benefit of the reviewed. Its supposed to be an open forum where people provide feedback based on actual experience. I will re-post my review and hopefully building management will not take it down this time.

See original review below.

The building itself is ok. Its a little old at this point. The staff doormen and maintenance are really good guys. Management is just ok. They dont work with you at all regarding your renewal. They actually penalize existing tenants and give newer tenants better prices. It makes zero sense but they take advantage of the fact that you are a loyal customer and dont necessarily want to deal with moving. Its not surprising that vacancies are as high as they have been since the financial crisis. There is so much more supply in the area and in the city in general and consumers can see that this  building, as from its location, is just mediocre at this point.

The Biggest issues are the construction that has been going on for a long time and will continue for at least 2 more years according to the construction site manager. The windows are ok but not sufficient to block out the noise of Jackhammers and drills that start at 7am. Also, because the construction is causing lane closures, there is always traffic outside on Houston, Bowery and Second Avenue. This causes ambulances to sit there for long periods of time with their sirens on. Sirens are always there regardless of the construction because Houston is a main artery to get across town but the construction just adds fuel to the fire. Its the most consistently loud apartment building I have ever been in hands down. It's unfortunate that its mine.

Quite frankly the building is unbearable and I would never choose to live here again.","Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

The location is close to unbeatable in the sense of being near awesome restaurants, great shopping and various subway lines.

Updated review",Matt P.,-1,1.0,"Absolutely awful place to live. Avoid this building like the plague. Horrible amenities, inept service workers, and absolutely god-awful, careless, disinterested management. Where to even begin... the light in my kitchen was flickering for months before they fixed it. The windows haven't been cleaned for years. The idiot in the package room who can't count how many packages you have in the system will ironically count every ""extra"" guest you might have on the roof. There is literally nothing redeeming about this building or there awful management company, UDR. Avoid 21 Chelsea like the British Covid-19 strain.","New York, NY",0,3,N/A,0
5/15/2018,Rick S.,-1,1.0,"We had a disappointing move-in experience that, hopefully, does not speak more broadly to the disorganization of the building management going forward.

At move-in, we were provided with a detailed invoice of how much we owe before taking possession of the keys. When logging into the system to pay this invoice, we noticed discrepancies between the online system and the invoice. Specifically, the online system said we owed the full amenity fee (whereas the invoice said we had a half off discount we previously negotiated) and a pet fee (which was voided as ""NA"" in the invoice we were provided). We were confused and had the below email exchange, with dollar figures removed:

Us: ""We just completed electronic signature and submission of the lease. Just to confirm, by what date are we required to make the initial payments outlined in the attachment you previously sent? We logged into the MyUDR system and are noticing the charges do not match what was quoted in your attachment. Specifically, the amenity fee is still showing up as [XXX], and there is an additional [XXX] pet fee that was slotted as not applicable in the attachment (both of which we used as the basis of signing the lease). Could you help us resolve these amounts, and also the timing?""

Leasing Office Employee: ""Regarding payment please refer to your welcome home coast [sic] sheet and not what the website is indicating. You will have to manually enter the amount to make the payment.""

Two weeks after our move in, we get an email saying we did not pay the [XXX] pet fee and needed to make payment. We were confused, given the explicit email exchange above where we had proactively called it out and were told we would actually not need to pay it. We sent this exchange to building management and were provided the following response:

Building Management: ""I can understand the email communication was confusing. Our portal at move in sometimes can seem complicated, so [Leasing Office Employee] would always refer back to the cost sheet. However, she did not update the cost sheet to reflect the [XXX] pet fee. That being said, the pet fee is still [XXX] as per your signed lease agreement and that mount [sic] is due.""

This disorganization is very frustrating, and the explanation that their system is so confusing that their employee doesn't rely on it didn't help things. If we were told from the beginning when we explicitly flagged the discrepancy that we still owed the pet fee, we would have not been upset. However, when you a) are told unambiguously to disregard the amount in the system after you actively bring up the difference, and b) are then on top of that told to manually enter a different amount per a separate invoice saying pet fee is voided, it is very frustrating to then be told you actually owe a higher amount after the fact. It is a bit like telling a cashier ""are you sure about this price because it is posted as different on the shelf?"", being confirmed that yes you should completely disregard the shelf price, then having the store show up at your house 2 weeks later asking you to foot a multi-hundred dollar bill to something you had been explicitly told was voided. The fact that they wouldn't take responsibility for their mistake I think reflects very poorly on commercial professionalism.","Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

I was immediately attracted to the building as we adore the Chelsea neighborhood and you can immediately see that the building is clean and calm and the building staff is attentive and amicable.  Natalie has been, without exception, an integral part in resolving our issues and the follow-through was instantaneous!

8/8/2016,Ali E.,-1,5.0,"I moved into 21 Chelsea 2 months ago and could not be happier. The building and it's amenities are extremely well kept and the staff are over the top nice. It honestly feels like I'm living in a hotel. The doormen, Agron (the super), and Natalie (the leasing agent) are what make the building truly special. Whether it is the doormen greeting you by name when you walk in the door, Argon taking care of any issues within hours of you making a request, or Natalie sending you an email to make sure that everything is up to par, you will quickly realize how above and beyond they go.

After doing a TON of research on the internet, I continued to see nothing but amazing reviews about 21 Chelsea. I had countless discussions with other real estate agents who wouldn't listen to our wants and needs during our search and I became extremely concerned about finding a place. However, the moment we stepped foot in Natalie's office, we knew that we had to live there. She was gracious, kind, informative, and professional. She took the time to show us a few different units as well as the amazing amenities. We filled out the application within minutes and signed the lease just a few days later. The entire process was so seamless, we were convinced it was too good to be true.

I really feel like I've found a home rather than just a temporary apartment. I can't say enough about how great this building and it's employees are. If you are looking for an apartment in NYC, look no further than 21 Chelsea.","New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

9/10/2019,Y F.,-1,5.0,"Have lived here since 2014. Building (previously ""Red Square"") was purchased by a developer and got new management a few years ago. The management is great and very easy to work with. It is a perk having management/leasing available, and they treat tenants with respect (speaking at least for myself). I have realized the value of this over the years, and it does make life a lot easier. ""Shout out"" for Stephen who is helpful and honest.

The building is on a unique corner of Houston Street that was always nice and is getting nicer. This area on Houston Street from the corner of Clinton Street to Orchard Street (by the new Equinox) is one of the best few blocks in Manhattan in my opinion. There is a bunch of storefronts open/opening downstairs such as the Y7 Yoga studio. Trader Joe is a few blocks south and Whole Foods is a few blocks west. Walks to both are pretty enjoyable - again, the building is really situated in a great spot for Manhattan.

Units generally have great views (floor-to-ceiling) and terraces. Most units have pretty clear sight of either Empire State Building views or Freedom Tower views. Again, it is rare to have great views in a ""hip"" part of town in Manhattan. Building also benefits from being built in ~1985 so avoids some of the weird layouts that newer construction tries to get away with. The renovation done over the past few years makes the building feel great. It might be silly, but it is pretty relaxing to come home through the giant glass doors and a welcoming foyer. Door staff is fantastic, including one (Yon Ten) who has been here for a long time and is beloved by current and past tenants, as well as friends, neighbors, etc. Packages never go missing, service requests are always filled quickly by Luis (on site super), building is kept immaculately clean by David, and all staff takes pride in their work.

Tenants are generally pretty great and enjoy living here. It's an interesting mix of people.

New York rents are getting expensive but this building is probably one of the best values in Manhattan thanks to its unique mix of location, views + terraces, generous layouts, and overall vibes. To be honest, it is difficult to move out of this building without sacrificing on something very pleasant no matter how much more (or less) you are willing to pay - whether it is listening to jazz at the Union Market next door, being able to make an Equinox class on time despite leaving your house 5 minutes earlier, sitting at a hip cafe on Clinton Street and running home to get your charger before your coffee is served, or waving to your neighbors from the balcony on a nice summer night, while looking down the Manhattan skyline from Manhattan. Is it heaven? No, but it helps.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

11/1/2017,Meghan H.,-1,5.0,"Moving from Ohio to NYC, I was skeptical of where to move, what neighborhood, and what borough.  I came upon 250 E Houston and was dubious of the building because of the construction.  I met with the leasing manager Stephen {who, by the way is a blast and full of personality :)} I appreciated him more than being fun because he was 150% honest about all the construction and repairs that would be taking place. There are no surprises living at the building. It is exactly what was made known.  
I viewed a 1BR unit with balcony and I am proud to say, I am and have been a resident of E Houston for five months now.  I absolutely love my apartment and the management team. From the manager Charlie, the super Luis who address any and all issues I have had; to the front desk staff all make me feel so happy to come home.

The women who works at the gym (at the entrance) came to me to say that I am not allowed to wear crop top at the gym. I was so surprised. I don't understand why someone tell me what to wear at the gym. And if all sport shops sell this kind of sport wear I think there is reason.
I love sportswear and it is even motivating me to go to the Gym.
And then she said that I am not allowed to take the pictures at the gym. It is crazy.
I am a model I love to Be healthy and in good shape. I like to post the pictures of healthy lifestyle, traveling, beautiful places. I have a lot of followers and traveling a lot. And this never happened to me before. Normally Gym is asking me to post the picture of myself and tag the Name of the Gym. And always happy to see a model wearing nice sport wear. I don't understand why I can't take the pictures( of cause I understand that I should not take the pictures of other people)
I feel uncomfortable to go to this Gym. Feel that someone always look after me to say that I am doing something wrong. Not very nice when you start your day with a workout and someone is stressing you.

6/12/2012,Mima G.,-1,1.0,"If you're looking for a building that is all gloss and no substance, then welcome to MiMA.

Be careful not to have any complaints as it's unlikely they will be taken seriously.

Once you step outside of the marketing hype and actually look at what a gym membership costs, the amenities and exorbitant rent just don't add up.

Now that the building is practically full, don't be surprised to wait up to 15 minutes for elevators on the higher floors and if one goes out of service (which has happened a lot recently), don't be surprised to wait even longer!

The free Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks coffee is just a gimmick. With it costing the building north of $7k per month to provide this, it's unlikely this is gonna last. Regularly the machines are either out of stock or not working and don't get me started on the milk.

If I was pushed to provide a positive about this building, it would be that the door staff are the best of any building bar none. They are real, humorous, understanding and very very courteous. Something their management office may like to take time to learn.

In New York, we have plenty of options when it comes to renting, don't get swept up by the hype about this place, it's just not worth the heartache or stress.

They are not nice and would make it their mission to make you feel bad. Do not count on using the facilities  - you are simply asked to go to your room.

2/19/2012,Steph G.,-1,1.0,"Biggest disappointment and mistake buying into the marketing hype about this building.

Since moving in, we have experienced nothing but problems. Issues with neighbors, issues with noise, issues with drugs, issues with services in the building.

Leasing seem to allow anyone to move into the building and I get that you can't pick and choose who you lease to, but you'd expect for how much they spent on the amenities that this building would be high end, but no. It's trailer-trash chic meets studentville.

Like some of the other reviews on here, the building truly is international which breeds a melting pot of issues. Fights on the basketball court, rudeness in general throughout the building and a management office that doesn't know what it's doing.

The only good thing about the building is the door staff and the fact it looks amazing, although, after only one year of being open, it's wearing badly.

When you move into a luxury building charging high rents, you expect a certain level of service and profile of person to live in the building. Not here, it's like a social experiment loaded with incompetent staff.

Sure, there will be positive reviews, but we are not the only couple who have regretted moving into this building. The only good thing about this whole situation is that our lease is up very soon so we can move away from here!","Manhattan, NY",0,1,N/A,0
1/18/2012,J P.,-1,1.0,"As the last person posted, this building is definitely not as great as it seems. Leasing will say anything to get you into the building (word to the wise, get any and all promises in writing!), the building is marketed as pet friendly, but make sure your cat or dog does not make a sound, otherwise you will be served with a Notice to Cure and charged for the privilege. There are many many many more issues with this building which I could cite, but the biggest issue is that for 651 apartments, there are not enough elevators and at times, particularly first thing in the morning, you can wait up to ten minutes on the higher floors.

As a side note, the building is full of ""international"" tenants, (read Korean/Chinese/Japanese) who love nothing more than going between each others apartments on each of the floors, so at times, you would be mistaken for thinking this is China Town, not Hells Kitchen. Second side note, do not consider making the MC Club business lounge your home. Excessive use seems to be frowned upon, despite being advised by leasing that it can be used as much as you like.","Manhattan, NY",0,2,N/A,0
11/1/2012,Richard A.,-1,2.0,"It seems that negative reviews about this building get filtered and that's not cool. As someone who lived at this building, it was the worst experience in my 16 years of leasing and owning property.

The building is finished to a high standard in the communal areas, however, once inside the apartment, the only three decent finishes are the floor, bathroom and kitchen. If you're lucky enough to live on a higher floor, you also get the views.

The door staff are flawless, professional and ALWAYS happy to help wherever they can. When it comes to the management office, you would be better off talking to yourself, you certainly would get more sense. The office is staffed with four people and with the exception of one of the team, nothing ever gets done by the others. They constantly send legal notices and charge you for it, fail to collect rent, multiple months at a time and then blame you for it.

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the rules within the building are insane. For the amount of rent you will pay, there certainly are better buildings where your business will be appreciated.

Some of the horror stories that have come out include a flooded elevator bank after a resident broke the sprinkler pipe and it took out the elevator bank. Not great in a 60+ story tower. Recently a snake was on the loose in the condominium part of the development. I'm pretty certain a brothel is being run from one of the apartments as one lady is forever in the elevator with different men, multiple times a day.

8/20/2014,Burt D.,-1,4.0,"We have lived in the MiMa half the week usually for the last two or more years. We also have a home in Nassau County, Long Island where we spend half the time. We decided we wanted to see how we like living in NYC. We have resided in a total of four apartments in the Ultra luxury side of the complex. We kept moving to larger apartments and of course more expensive apartments because we were looking for the ultimate in the building. We now reside in the largest apartment in the building and it is beautiful. We are moving out of the building to the Upper West Side so I thought it was time to write a review.

We absolutely loved every aprtment we resided in here. There isn't a bad view in the entire building. We chose the 460 address side of the building because we wanted better finishings and we are very glad we did. I have had a few issues witrh the Management and no matter how much I may have been an annoyance LOL they have always been very professional and very amenable. Almost every employeee we like very much and we will truly miss the place. The Concierges go  out of their way to make you feel wellcome. At least most of them. I do have problem with a couple of them who really should consider another career but on balance other then an issue or two with the two Concierges the other ones were terrific. I can say that I feel that I have made friends with them and not just a resident employee relationship. They are very well trained and very nice people. Unfortunately they have too many temps working here from time to time.

The Handymen and the Assistant Resident Manager and his associate may be the best in the entire City. The Previous General Manger was terrific and I was upset when he left. The Resident Manager although we have had one difference has been terrific. Anytime there was a problem with the apartments they were right there to fix the issue and we did not have to wait more then usually a few hours. Read that again a few hours, not a few days.

The employees in the Leasing Office and Management Office have never let us down. They are professional and have gone out of their way for us.

The amenities are the best in the entire City with a full court basketball court, and Equinox gym, indoor and outdoor movie theaters, sauna, Steam, grill areas, recreation and party areas, a business center with at no cost coffee all day long, a beautiful swimming pool and much more.

So again we are going to miss this place and almost everyone here including some of the residents that we have become friendly with. Not all of them but many of them.

Now for a few things that I think they need to work on:

We have dogs and MiMa is very pet friendly. However they have not been able to get a handle on some of the residents allowing their dogs to urinate and defecate on or very near the egresses and walls and columns of the complex. I undestand that they may be concerned about losing tenants but unfortunately for people who covet their apartments like we do we walk through it at times and bring it in to the building. It also smells pretty bad especially during the warmer weather. They do powerwash but five minutes later the same culprits do the same thing with their dogs and don't seem to have any respect for their own living environment.

The other issue is the neighborhood. We know that Hells Kitchen is much better now then years ago but it is still sort of heinous and quite filthy. There a lot of tourists and a lot of noise around here especially with all the trucks and cars exiting the Lincoln Tunnel. The back of the building many times is quite a mess and the Covenant House is at the back of the building across the street and many of their reisdents attempt to cause mayhem when they can. They hang out around the back of the buiding at times smoking pot and worse. When we walk our dogs back there it's not good.

So we have decided to move and it has been a difficult decision. The two main reasons is the exterior environment and the dog excrment and this review will not come as a surprise to mangement and I am sure they will know who is writing it. On balance again we will miss the MiMa and maybe one day we will be back. One never knows unless they don't like this review.","Manhattan, NY",0,1,N/A,0

10/17/2015,Brookie W.,-1,1.0,"Renter beware - looks can be deceiving! Sure, Avalon Fort Greene is a lovely building, with nice apartments with terrific views (for now, given the number of high rises springing up nearby), lovely staff, and a great location. However the rent is exceptionally high (though there are worse options in downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene) which leads to lots of college kid neighbors crammed five and six to an apartment, and the accompanying noise and hallway trash.

Worse, expect Avalon to hit you with a monster rent increase when you renew your lease (a trick they pull off by offering you a ""special"" introductory rate, then jacking it up to ""market rate"" plus the maximum increase allowed by New York law in year two.) In our case, the year two increase was 14%. Then, when by the grace of God, you finally find a more reasonably priced place to live and move out, expect Avalon to keep your security deposit -- and maybe even tack on ADDITIONAL charges, regardless of how clean or undamaged you leave the apartment. You will be charged for a full repaint, even if you never changed the white paint color, for wear and tear on the walls and floors, and for whatever else they can think of in order to avoid refunding your deposit.

After living at Avalon for two years, I can only conclude that the company's business model is to grab as much of your money as possible, in as many ways as they can (high rent, fees for amenities that are free in other buildings, like the gym, move-out fees, etc) which of course is the business model of just about every landlord -- Avalon is just particularly flagrant.

The bottom line: the spectacular greed of this company, which operates similar buildings nationwide, should provide ample reason to take your rental business elsewhere.","Brooklyn, NY",0,2,N/A,0

4/3/2016,Brian W.,-1,3.0,"My wife and I have been living at Avalon Fort Greene for a little over 2 years, and have experienced many pros and cons with this building.

Pros:
- Pet Friendly
- Convenient Location: Close to all major metro lines (2,3,4,5,F,G,A,C,E,Q,N,R), restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops.
- The front desk/concierge is absolutely amazing.  They are always quick to offer a lending hand, or friendly smile.  We've particularly enjoyed getting to know Erdan and Emil further, and after awhile they start to feel like family.
- Maintenance is always responsive and very professional

Cons:
- Constant smell of marijuana throughout the building.  This is largely in part due to many tenants viewing their apartments as dorm rooms.
- Many apartments rent out their places on AirBnb, so you aren't necessarily sure who your neighbors will be.
- Large uncertainties with renewal rate increases. Can range anywhere from 1% to 30% in a given year.

On one occasion, I believe it was in November 2018, I'd moved an SUV load of household items from many states away (13-hour trip).  I arrived at the Avalon Fort Greene earlier than expected so I didn't have anyone to help me move yet.  Angel from the maintenance crew saw that I was moving items in the loading dock.  He asked if I needed help carrying the items to the loading elevator.  Not only did he carry them to the loading elevator for me, but he then proceeded to ride the elevator with me to my apartment floor.  He didn't stop there. He decided to help me move those items into my apartment as well. He didn't stop there.  He then went back downstairs with me to the loading dock and help me move ALL OF MY ITEMS from the SUV to my apartment.  He was so kind to me.  He made me feel like Avalon Ft. Greene family.  He told me about his wonderful wife and beautiful children as if we'd known each other.  It was just such a blessing.  This is why I keep coming back to the Avalon.

Working with Diana Rufus who is (absolutely amazing) has been a blessing. Diana is knowledgeable, understanding, pleasant and most gracious.

Legit you will smell smoke as soon as you walk out either entrance. I hope you love sirens everyday. You will be asked for money at least 4 times before you hit the side walk leaving or entering the building.

Second, the leasing staff may be the most unprofessional bunch of low level narcissists I have ever dealt with. Never have I met such people with so little authority to make decisions acting like they actually know what they are doing when having to make a phone call to a corporate office for every decision.

There is a serious water issue and numerous apts have brown water and they cannot fix it. It is not fair that they are signing new tenants and not warning them of this serious health issue.
The building is not secure. There is no true doorman, and we have a  concierge sometimes. Non residents use our facilities, and have harassed residents.

5/7/2018,K W.,-1,1.0,"WARNING: DO NOT MOVE INTO AVA DOBRO-You'll regret it.

We've been at Ava Dobro for a month now and it's been a rough one. Within a few days of moving in, a hate crime was committed on our floor-dicks and swastikas drawn on a doorway-we are Jewish, so this was extremely concerning. After that, for 3 weeks, we had brown water coming out of all of our faucets. We complained numerous times to management and on the AvaDobro Neighbors Facebook group, but this issue was resolved weeks later! Unbelievable! We have been assured by staff that the brown water is safe for consumption, but it literally looks like feces is in the water. They also mentioned that it was safe for consumption, but didn't recommend drinking it which completely contradicts itself. Since then, the gate at the dog park was broken-we had to call maintenance over 3 times and this issue wasn't resolved for days until we posted about it on the AvaDobro Neighbors Facebook group. Both my fiancé and I were deleted and blocked from the group for no reason. When we asked Jade (head of leasing) why we were blocked and our posts were deleted, he began verbally harassing my fiancé even lashing out with anti Semitic slurs. After my fiancé approached him about the swastikas that were being drawn on doors here, he brushed it off saying ""it's happening everywhere"". That same day, another member of the leasing staff (Megan) publicly humiliated and verbally abused my fiancé-she basically told us that we need to leave the building.

Another issue we've faced is the lack of security in the building. At night, I've waited over 10 minutes trying to find a concierge for help-meanwhile after looking around I've found them in the back room on their phones. This is a complete security risk as anyone could come into the building and you would think that they would be extremely vigilant now that a hate crime has happened on the premises.

Another issue with the lack of security is that someone gained unauthorized access to an apartment and stole a puppy. AvaDobro has somehow covered this up, but basically they're willing to give anyone a key to any apartment and are not concerned about the security risks of doing so-which is why a puppy was stolen from the building. All of these issues have been covered up instead of fixed or revealed to the wonderful people that pay a lot of money to live in this building.

And after all of these issues, the General Manager (Steve) sides with his leasing team over the tenants that are paying $3,000+ to live here.

Just don't move in-you'll regret it. The leasing staff will pretend to care about your concerns, but the reality is that this building is being run by children.","Brooklyn, NY",1,7,4,0

Say what?

Why shut out the residents of your building from enjoying the amenities they are paying for, especially on holidays?I can now see in an email they sent out only yesterday that it is closed for a private event. This is an injustice. I think we are going to move out when our lease ends soon, as this is super hypocritical to do something like this to your residents. It shows you do care that you may have ruined countless people's plans on this special night. How much money were you paid for this ""private event"" and was it worth letting the bulk your residents down and disappointing the Ava DoBro community?

Many of our friends in the building are upset too. With so many new buildings opening in the area, we are not going to renew our lease at this rate. How hypocritical can you be Ava team?

She was quick to return my calls and emails as I continued my search and a delight to work with.  I also want to give mention to Rachel who helped me out on my followup visits when I wanted to get exact measurements for my unit. Her professionalism and friendly personality were top notch.

8/2/2016,Steve H.,-1,5.0,"This review covers only my two appointments with Andrea K., a leasing agent at AVA DoBro.

*Fast Response*
I emailed and called over a dozen highrises in the Financial District and about six highrises around downtown Brooklyn over a 24-hour period. The AVA DoBro was the first to respond and set up an appointment. Their website (avadobro.com) is quite helpful.

*Andrea*
I visited 11 highrises in the financial district, 5 miscellanous buildings in midtown, and a handful of places in Brooklyn over a period of 3 days. I met dozens of leasing agents in some of the most well-known buildings in NYC (and therefore the world). I spoke with or emailed many, many more. Andrea was by far the most charismatic, and that made my decision to lease at the AVA DoBro so much easier.

*Application*
The application process is fast and easy. The entire application is electronic: on the AVA DoBro website or through email. For me, the application took 5-8 minutes. There are followup procedures, but that is true of any apartment.

If you are looking for an apartment in Downtown Brooklyn or around FiDi, I suggest checking out the AVA DoBro and asking for Andrea. She'll tell you everything you need to know, and answer even the most uneducated questions.","New York, NY",0,2,N/A,0

9/15/2021,Antoine D.,-1,1.0,"1. Two of the four passenger elevators have been out of service for several months. It can take 10-15 minuets to get up or down the building during rush hour and many times there is a line going out the front door. The building has offered no communication to residents about what the issue is or the estimated time it will take to resolve the issue.

2. The package valet has still not returned to normal hours. If you work a daytime 9-5 schedule; just keep in mind that you will only be able to collect your packages on Saturdays. With these hours I would prefer that there was no valet holding my packages hostage all week.

3. Much of the building is rented as short term AirBnB's. Nearly all the unit 12's are leased by the same short term leasing company that flexes 8 rooms into a two bedroom apartment. The building is aware of how these units are being used and does not do anything to police the issue.

4. A woman was just recently murdered, stuffed into an oil barrel, and wheeled out the front door on a luggage cart by a known gang member resident. Really!

5. They do not protect the walls and elevators during move-ins / move-outs so most of the walls are scuffed and look old and abused and never get repaired.

6. The office staff is extremely slow at responding. They will go days without responding to simple requests and will often require follow up to finally receive resolution to any issues.","Financial District, New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

Harold, from the leasing office, made the leasing process a breeze for me and my roommates, especially when we moved into a larger unit within the building. The staff is incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. The doormen make an effort to get to know all their tenants, which really shows in their ability to know guests vs tenants, stopping all guests not with a tenant to check-in at the front desk. Being a twenty-something woman in the city, my parents were always impressed and thankful for the level of security they provided.

The apartments are recently renovated with a ton of light and top notch appliances/finishes. Any issues we ever had with the apartment were resolved within 24 hours.

The amenities are great and well kept.  The rooftop includes grills, which we got a lot of use out of. The gym is open 24/7 and is on the top floor with natural light. The package room/valet offers some of the best prices and customer service around (Mark is the best!!).

Any repairs needed were handled within at least 24 hours, shared spaces like the gym/roof were always kept clean and a package was never lost or stolen.

3/9/2017,Yessengeldy R.,-1,5.0,"I have never posted on Yelp before, to be honest I created this account to thank the leasing team for the help, especially Harold Burrows HBurrows@udr.com! I live in 2325 as of January 2017. He assisted me to sign my lease in under a day! That was a miracle after suffering for weeks with 70 Pine. Honestly his work and assistance is a gem after suffering with bureaucracy of other buildings in NYC. I actually referred a friend who struggled with approval in other buildings and got 500$ as a credit!
Harold is 5 star broker, the building is 4.5!
Although the facilities are good, I have to use back elevator if I have my bike. That elevator is not in the best condition, unlike passenger's elevators in front. Furthermore my apartment had some minor damages on the hardwood floor from the previous residents. I bought a carpet so they are not visible anymore.
Besides this, building is amazing.

2/24/2017,David K.,-1,5.0,"95 Wall Street - the hidden gem!

I'm not one to make a review (as you can tell from my history of reviews) however I made it an effort to review 95 Wall Street. This hidden gem offers outstanding amenities, stunning apartments, and an elegant entrance.  But most importantly, as with any home, the people make it livable. I give special recognition to the staff at 95 Wall Street. They make it feel like home. As a returning tenant of the building, and with many options to live in other buildings, it was a no brainer to come back to 95 Wall Street. I want to give special thanks to Harold Burrows for making it such a smooth transition and for his attention to detail. He truly listens and cares about what the client wants, and finds the ""right"" unit for them. He also has a wealth of knowledge about the neighborhood and the property. Also, I commend the manager Josh for keeping 95 Wall Street an outstanding property. I can only imagine how much work it is to keep up with the consistency in excellence.

Hopefully this review offers some guidance when you are choosing your place to live.","Jersey City, NJ",2,4,3,0

The staff has become family to me and I'm so grateful to call 95 Wall home!

9/21/2016,Courtney C.,-1,5.0,"My fiancee and I relocated to Manhattan about seven months ago and decided that the Financial District was where we wanted to live. Although many only think of Wall Street when thinking of the Financial District, the reality is that there is so much more! From the endless amount of trendy and delicious food trucks and healthy, affordable food chains, to the overwhelming amount of stylish, hip, young professionals, the Financial District is one of New York City's oldest, yet newest up and coming neighborhoods. Prior to our move, we spent several weeks looking online for an apartment and eventually decided that it would be best to spend a week in New York viewing apartments with a broker. We viewed dozens of properties and they all seemed the same, expensive small units without any views, cold and uninviting lobbies, and basic amenities. Upon stepping foot into 95 Wall St., we instantly knew that this was the place for us! The lobby was warm and inviting, yet trendy and alive with energy. The doormen were not only welcoming and kind, but they were on top of their job in that as dozens of people walked in and out of the building, they knew exactly who was a resident and who was not, which instantly created a sense of safety, being a top priority when selecting a place to live. Being the owners of two large dogs, we found it almost impossible to find a luxury apartment complex that would even consider us to be residents. Upon walking through the lobby at 95 Wall St., we couldn't help but to notice the vast amount of well behaved dogs and friendly dog owners. Although amenities was not a priority, while touring the property, we were amazed with the roof top basketball court, the well equipped gym, the large and stylish lounge, and the in unit laundry. To top it off, 95 Wall St. also provides breakfast to it's residents Monday through Friday in the lounge. There is a one time amenity fee, but it is well worth it, especially for anyone who has a busy schedule and who enjoys the convenience of grabbing breakfast and working out all in the same place. We signed a six month lease because NYC was fairly new to us and we wanted the option to move as we became more familiar with the city and in case we found a better place to live. As our lease came to an end, we knew that 95 Wall St. was our home and we did not have any desire to leave. We signed a twelve month lease and upgraded to a larger unit, where the leasing staff at 95 Wall St. was of much assistance, making the move a smooth transition. We truly feel like we are part of a community here, where all staff members know us and our dogs on a first name basis. There is an online community site, similar to Facebook, where residents have immediate access to everything and anything in regards to living at 95 Wall. St. You can communicate with residents, view and pay your bills, place a service request for your apartment, or speak with management directly. Service requests are addressed immediately and management provides instant feedback and assistance with any questions one may have. Upon reading some negative reviews, I could not disagree more! Yes, there are broker's fees, resulting in the cost to slightly increase, but this is Manhattan and is one of the most expensive places to live in the world and if one does their homework and research prior to moving here as we did, nothing should come as a surprise. We absolutely love living here and I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a fabulous and safe place to live, with a warm and inviting staff that really does make it's residents feel as if they are part of a community!","New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

From the very beginning, Barbara made me feel completely at home and immediately found me the perfect unit. She even took my parents on a brief tour before I moved in properly! She was very up-front about fees, extended a great special for September move-in, and made it very clear what was necessary for application/approval. After I signed on the unit, she coordinated everything from my service elevator booking to first maintenance requests.

Fernando greeted us by name and all of our maintenance requests were completed within 24-48 hours - most were within 6 hours.  

The ONLY issue we had with the building was the rent price.  When our lease ended, the new rent was too high for us, but the leasing office worked with us to try to find a solution.  Sadly, we simply couldn't keep up... but we wanted to stay.

We would highly recommend 95 Wall for anyone interested in a clean building, with fast response times for any maintenance problems, and a FANTASTIC staff.","New York, NY",0,5,N/A,0

5/14/2015,Bill J.,-1,1.0,"I lived in this dump for two years and trust me, the only thing 'luxury' about this place is the rent.  The worst part about this place is the management company, Milford.  There's a short, fat and very insecure building manager who will thinks she's a landlord in a Charles Dickens novel.  She'll proudly proclaim her title and try to use it as influence when she's as intellectually equipped as a toddler, and emotionally equipped even less.  This woman is accustomed to dealing with slugs and such who are rent controlled, as it's a mixed zoned building.  So while you're subsidizing those worthless passive aggressive Jewish old women who are annoying to share an elevator with, you'll have to tolerate to superior tone of a 'landlord' accustomed to dealing with the dregs but not at all with anyone who can afford their apartments.  They claim to be a family building and I've counted only 4 children in the 100+ units.  They're in the middle of a terrible area with more homeless people than patronable stores, the best thing at that cross street is the food vendor (Sam).  The best part of the building are the concierges, who were excellent.

I know that one neighbor stays up all night watching TV, the tenants above me make so much noise that you would think elephants lived there. The staff is pleasant but there are only one or two who actually do anything for you. The rest stare at you blankly when you are unloading a taxi or come home with heavy packages. The person ""in charge"" in the management office is the worst I have ever seen in a building in my 20 years of living in manhattan. He's rude and doesn't give a shit if you have a complaint.

The sales staff explained the process clearly and in less than 24hrs I had been approved and shortly after signed the contract and was ready to move in. The building staff is responsive and friendly - they know most of the residents on a first name basis. I moved into a new apartment so there were few hiccups, most were solved by the building staff quickly or outside technicians were brought in. I didn't have to coordinate anything. The building is well managed and maintained, the lobby/common areas are being renovated as I write this. The gym is fine ( enough machines), and is never crowded. The rooftop terrace is a nice amenity. Location could not be better - dozens of stores/restaurants literally at your doorstep. Excellent transport links with express trains running trains running 24hr. Times sq is 10 mins away - door to door. If you like golf, nyc van cortland golf club (the only one reachable by public transport) is a 30 min ride away. Most corners of the city are reachable within 30-35 mins.

The unit has a new murphy bed to create more space, a walk in closet and all new fixtures in the bathroom, making it even more attractive than the place already is!

Unit: The apartment have a very contemporary feel to it. The studio units are small, but there is a lot packed into the small space - kitchenette with dishwasher, decent sized refrigerator, to go with two walk in closets (at least in my unit).

Amenities: For me the gym was a big selling point. It's not Equinox (there is one right across on Broadway), but better than a lot of the apartment gyms you'll find in the city. Laundry, Bike room, roof access etc. are great to have as well.

Staff: Especially the folks at the front desk are extremely friendly and accommodating.

1) Upscale apartment with modern fixtures
2) Murphy bed to create more space in unit
3) Walk-in closet (may vary by apartment of course)
4) Great amenities - Gym / Community space with pool table, flat screen, & ample couch space / Rooftop deck (open when the season is favorable)
5) Friendly, reliable staff
6) Safe - Fobs are necessary to access gym & community room, 24-hour doorman
7) Laundry in-building
8) Offers dry cleaning and laundry pick-up & drop-off and
9) Access to the necessities near building: Dry cleaning, grocery stores, pharmacies, and 2 blocks from the 96th St. subway station.

There is certainly a high price tag for the apartment, but if you are willing and have the ability to spend the money, you will have a great payoff, especially if you take advantage of all the great amenities and convenience that Greystone has to offer the busy young professional / student.","San Francisco, CA",1,6,N/A,0

9/17/2014,Olga T.,-1,5.0,"I'm in love with this place! I was looking for a new apartment in the city and targeted buildings with facilities like gym and front desk. Moved in here 2 months ago. I want to share the information 'cause I know how hard it is to find a place you can call home in NYC:
1. The best value for money. I avoided $3000 min agent fee for this type of apt because I worked with management directly (located in the same building). Second, I just paid about $100 application fee without any other condo application fees which all other buildings required ($300-$700 on the top of $100).The moving deposit is just $100 and was returned right away. If you meet the standard requirements deposit is only one month which you will never find in such buildings.
2. Moving-in. When I was looking for an apartment with my agent I found Greystone myself and walked in. The application process took 20 min and I had the contract in my arms in a couple of days. Management is super friendly and professional. The apt was clean with a brand new kitchen and bathroom + installed AC.
3. Location! I LOVE this area. UWS is the best place to live. Wholefoods, Trader Joe's, dry cleaners, restaurants, yoga studios, corner shops, pharmacies, different stores, and CENTRAL PARK are all walkable distance from this place!
4. Facilities. New gym with everything you need. I go there every morning. TV, pool to play and the best roof I had so far (sofas, space to suntan, tables to eat outside).
5. Staff. Super friendly, smiley and helpful. We always have our problems solved the same day.

I am currently suing them for constructive eviction. They ignored the summons that was sent to them by the State of New York and even tried to hire a debt collector to come after me. The debt collector had one conversation with my lawyer, apologized, and returned the debt to Brooklyner, telling them to respond to the lawsuit against them. It's been a week and still no response. I wonder if they realize it's illegal not the respond to papers served, and even more so to try to collect a debt that you're currently and actively being sued for. They don't seem interested in doing things legally or correctly. Rent at your own peril.","San Francisco, CA",0,4,N/A,0

One conversation with my lawyer and the debt collector apologized and told Brooklyner to handle it themselves/it wasn't a valid debt. Three days later and no calls have been returned to my legal counsel. I would appreciate a call back if you're reading this, Equity Residential.

3/1/2016,Anonymous P.,-1,1.0,"While the building is close to many subway lines, in my view, the price is unjustifiable.  If you plan to stay more than one year, don't be surprised by 10-15% hikes in rent.  The building lists a doorman but there is nobody that opens doors or helps with bags, only a person that sits behind a desk.  Walls are thick but doors are thin and from the hallway you can hear in the apartments and vice versa.  
The neighborhood has many convenient stores, however, I wouldn't want my sister to walk around alone at night.  Approximately five times in the last year I have left the building to see people going to the bathroom openly in the street.  If you have a car, expect long waits when picking up your car, sometimes in excess of 15 minutes.  In my opinion, the only good thing about the building is the roof deck view and the gym.","Brooklyn, NY",7,10,N/A,0
12/7/2015,James C.,-1,1.0,"I'd like to first clarify that I have lived at the brooklyner for over 4 years and I currently still live at the brooklyner, so I've seen a large amount of change since my first year.  Let me be very clear with my review.....DO NOT RENT HERE!

You probably walk in and see spectacular views from the roof top, and great views from your apartment.  You have dreams of entertaining people on the rooftop terrace during the summer and staying there for a long period of time. The only problem is that

-The rooftop is usually rented out at least once a week, but you will get no compensation as a resident for the loss of time for enjoying these amenities

-The rent has skyrocketed but by illegal practices.  It is a rent stabilized apartment but they generally try to force you out every year so they can turn over the apartment.  They also raise it illegally higher than they are supposed to.  Don't believe me?  Be sure to go to this website

metcouncilonhousing.org

or this one

nyshcr.org/Rent/tenantre…

and get the rental history, if they report for the unit that you are looking at [which they are legally supposed to, sometimes they haven't put all the tenants in the report] it you will see that there have been ASTRONOMICAL raises in rent.  

My advice to you is to print out everything and go in to negotiate for 1K below what they are offering.  I'll be sure to make a website about all the atrocities at the brooklyner again.  Everything from Lawris Brown [the former manager who had a floor of prostitutes that he offered low rent to, the 32nd floor] to Justin Scarpa [ the current manager who charged me $100 fee to stay in my own apartment, which I am refusing to pay ]

If you do get a deal on rent, save the money for your eventual tenant attorney and litigation.  Believe me, I am!","Brooklyn, NY",0,2,N/A,0
4/17/2013,Dan K.,-1,1.0,"I am nearing completion of my one year lease and I won't renew it.  Although the building, apartment amenities and staff is very friendly and responsive, the level of noise in the apartment coming from the street is absolutely intolerable.

The building is located in the middle of MetroTech in downtown Brooklyn and as a consequence noise emanating from garbage truck, heavy machinery, etc is absolutely out of control.  What makes it even worse is the fact that the whole trucks activity starts at midnight and goes on till 5 am every night.  

If you rent in the building make sure to have a hefty supply of ear plugs and/or noise cancelling Bose heavy duty headphones.  In addition, downtown Brooklyn area is absolutely boring with no food, entertainment, etc. and constant view of project dwellers on nearby Fulton Street.

Also, $2,800 that i pay for one-bedroom apartment in downtown Brooklyn you can find an excellent place in the city with vibrant community, great food and tons of stuff to do.","Brooklyn, NY",0,1,N/A,0

The location is great for those transitioning out of Manhattan, all the subway lines are within walking distance, and my commute was shorter than some coworkers who live in the city. Every place is going to have it's pros and cons, but some of the negative reviews on here seem a bit extreme. Here's our take:

Pros
-The onsite maintenance team is great. Every request we submitted was fixed within 24 hours, and they were always very friendly.

-The leasing office is also very helpful, in particular Elanna who rented us the unit. We were worried about getting our security deposit back because of some reviewers saying they had theirs unfairly withheld. We just got ours back and we only moved out 3 weeks ago. I've never had a deposit returned to me that quickly in the 12 years I've been renting in NYC.

-Our unit was spotless when we moved in, literally the cleanest apt I've ever moved into. They do a great job keeping the common areas clean as well.

Cons
-I do agree that the concierge aren't helpful. None of them have ever opened the door for me when I was carrying heavy things or trying to wheel a dolly in and out of the building. They literally just sit and stare at you while you try to open the door and maneuver inside.

-There aren't any good restaurants nearby other than some decent chains (Chipotle, Five Guys, etc). If you want something that isn't a franchise, you'll have to walk to Brooklyn Heights or Boerum Hill. (It's not that far, but we get lazy in the winter).

For us, these minor cons were definitely outweighed by the good. We decided to move to NJ to be closer to my family and have more space, otherwise we would have continued to live here.","Manhattan, NY",2,16,N/A,0

2/21/2016,Maria T.,-1,1.0,"This building has a ton of problems they need to work through. It's been a year but there are still a ton of growing pains this building is going through. The comments from the other reviewer is just an example.

Here are a few constant problems with the building:
- Elevator problems
- Heating problems
- Fitness facilities, constantly something needs to be fixed
- Response time from the manager and leasing staff is terrible.
- Twice there has been water leaks in the building. This last one completely flooded the lobby and downstairs facilities where they will be inaccessible for a time they cannot tell us
- Security could be better. Only one person minding the entrance. Very easy for someone who is not allowed to walk in the building walk in. I have had several guests walk in unannounced. Most luxury buildings have at least two people downstairs.

This is supposed to be a full luxury building. Especially for the excessive amount of rent Prism thinks they deserve for their units.

Management also offers renters an option to break the lease in the first month if something turns up to be unsatisfactory, which I thought was a plus.

4/9/2018,Carlos L.,-1,5.0,"A true gem of NYC! After having a horrible experience at a large building during my first year in the City I almost randomly visited the Prism when visiting options to move. I was instantly convinced, there are few buildings in Manhattan that perform this well on almost every aspect for the price range it's in. The location is outstanding right on top of the six line and near the NQR trains. The area is also lively with numerous restaurants and bars as well as near the Flatiron district. Furthermore, the service is outstanding, never seen something like this in the City. Every employee of the building is polite beyond any expectations in the usually dull NYC. I was impressed by the true concern by the residents well being 24/7. Another great plus is the size of the building, with only 22 floors and few apartments per floor the amount of people is always reasonable, no elevator jams, little to no wait for packages. Lastly, the amenities offered by the building are comparable to any high-end subscription gym. It includes a lap pool, modern machines, weights, spinning cycles and even classes. I am sad to leave NYC after having a wonderful experience at the Prism, it really became an oasis in the chaos that NY can be.","Toronto, Canada",241,4,N/A,0

Pros: Clean, New, Flawless amenities. And most importantly very efficient and kind staff. Sure, the rent can get you a bigger space. But this building is comfortable for the NYC life. Having newly finished apartments means it doesn't get dirty as fast, the air temperature does not fluctuate like in a walk up or older building and the walls are pretty much soundproof. Location, Location, Location. Everywhere that I need to go to, is about a 15 min walk or 15 min cab ride. And if its not, the 6 train pretty much has transfers to most major subway lines.
Cons: ultra modern, for those of you that prefer a traditional or classic aesthetic. Some neighbors are pretentious yet some are wonderful and now I call some of my good friends, so just take your pick :)","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

I honestly cannot say that I have come across a building that tops the Prism. All of the amenities you can ask for at your finger tips. I go to work, come home and am back in instance paradise. I take full advantage of the gym they have here, its great. After a long workout I hit the steam room for 30 minutes and finish off with laps in the pool (yea, the building has all of this). Since I have been here they have done a full revamping of the staff, and in my opinion, a job well done! The buildings superintendent Wilson is as helpful as it gets. whether it be a routine maintenance request, or a weird favor that I need, he gets it done! He is running a tight ship, and it makes my life MUCH easier. Not having to worry about repairs being taken care of goes a LONG way in NYC (I'm sure you've heard of the horrible superintendents in the industry).

The best part of living here is the gym and pool, which is never crowded and regularly cleaned (still smells like new). The building staff is also amazing - they are always friendly and responsive. They recently brought in a new community manager, Jordan, which was much needed. The last manager was a total jerk and rude.

1/24/2021,Lucy W.,-1,1.0,"This review is for Sandra and Sandra only. What a nasty woman. Terrible at communicating. For example, asked for an appointment to see some units for a certain day and she says there are none available that day. That's fine, but give me some alternatives? I ask her for times for another day, all she tells me is yes that day is available- but does not include any times. This goes on for a while.

I show up to my appointment, I was running late and felt badly.  I sent her an email 15 min it is prior saying I'd be 10 minutes late and if that was ok, apologizing profusely. No response. I call her when I'm off the subway walking over. She just repeatedly tells me she's booked booked booked and tells me to come before a certain time, which I say I can and will. She then repeats to me how busy she is. I get to my appointment and just the expected nastiness from her. No greeting. Just straight asks me ""what's your price"". I tell her my range, she takes me to a unit and while we're entering I ask. So which unit is this? She reads me the unit number which I can clearly already see on the door, because I have eyes and reading comprehension. Can barely tell me net effective or gross.

Just overall really poor communication abilities mixed with a sour uninviting and nasty attitude. The building seems lovely but her on the other hand, wish I could say the same. You can absolutely find comparable buildings in the area with pleasant staff.","New York, NY",304,8,N/A,0

1/3/2018,Lauren F.,-1,2.0,"My husband and I lived here for 2 years. The apartment itself is great (unless you need something fixed, don't hold your breath with the building staff) The appliances are cheap and the apartment is small, but location is great, it is quiet and if you are high enough there is great light.

However be weary of construction around the area -- it was much quieter 2 years ago than it is now.

We had numerous problems with the building staff. Particularly with Jose the main doorman who on more than one occasion raised his voice abrasively or threatened to call the building manager. One time was for a delivery that was unscheduled because we had no idea how big the box was and another was for multiple packages that were left at the front desk which we picked up within 4 hours of delivery.

On another occasion, I reserved the building roof on behalf of my brother in law to surprise my sister and they sent her the contract by mistake, obviously spoiling the surprise. Not only did they NOT offer to comp the reservation fee, but they made no apology.

1 week before we moved out, they sanded and painted the doors over the weekend with 12 hours notice to the tenants. There was an inch of dust under our door when we returned from a weekend away. A stroller scratched the door before we moved out and they took $125 out of our security deposit because they ""didn't want to get in trouble with Rose Associates"" The moment you decline to extend your lease, they look to hit you up for money at every opportunity. It took 3 months to get our security deposit back. They also double booked the elevator the day we were moving out which delayed our move by at least an hour and a half and caused us to pay the movers overtime.

On a positive note, the dry cleaners are great, respectful and always deliver on time.","Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

I must say the maintenance staff is great Ivan is great, leasing is helpful( Garrison and Melissa), the Front Desk staff is Solid, Jean has been by far the most helpful concierge. The guy is always here and works extensively around the clock. BUT oddly his name isn't on the holiday list, and he wasn't in on his regular night shift. Yesterday We ask the Front Desk Supervisor (who mistaken me for a delivery boy on an early encounter when i first moved in, Yes! I didn't forget that Patrick ) why isn't Jean name on the list? He says he found better opportunities. I call BS! . Today they sent a mass email asking residents to run water for 30 secs- two minutes because there has been a big problem with the water lately it's been brown and nasty like...total BS! The worst part is they do not compensate the residents for their mistakes there is always a new excuse or something will be done but take over a couple days to get it done.

Updated review",Cody P.,-1,1.0,"The elevators are constantly broken. Earlier this week, only one worked. Today two are working. Imaging waiting twenty minutes to get down to the lobby. So pathetic. The building manager (Lauren) hasn't even emailed about this latest problem. What a joke. To make matters worse, one of the long term doormen quit, so we have temps on the lobby who have no idea what they are doing. What a secure building!!! Pathetic!!

Update: August 4 -- for the past three days, two or three of the elevators have been taken offline. One day this week only ONE of the elevators worked. Multiple times, an elevator would pass our floor but no one could get on due to the overcrowding.

To compensate, the lovely management crew was serving wine to residents as they walked in the building today - probably to calm tempers!!

Message to Avalon Management: I am contacting corporate leadership. Your negligence is putting residents safety at risk. People are getting trapped in the elevators at all hours of the day. You have bungled the management of this situation and you should consider resigning.","Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,14,4,0

It has begun to feel unsafe at night as there is constant loitering, smoking, and mask-less yelling directly in front of the doors to the building. They have even shut down the revolving doors as those who did not live here were loitering in the lobby of the building and the front desk did not feel comfortable. Surprised that Avalon has yet to hire a someone to maintain the well-being of not only the occupants but the staff as well.

Updated review",Antonio D.,-1,5.0,"It is wonderful to live in a building where there is someone like Brian who works as concierge. Brian is always greeting residents and other people entering the building with a beautiful smile and a genuine warmth that makes everyone feels at home. Brian goes above and beyond to help anyone, even predicting their needs and making sure that everyone that he comes in contact with is happy. A few times that I could not find my keys, without even asking him, Brian left whatever he was doing to accompany me and open the door for me. Brian's customer service is not just about making people satisfied of the services he provides, he has a very good heart and he shows a real compassion and understanding that is rare to find nowadays. When I leave to travel out of town, Brian wishes me farewell like a family member would. He's so authentically caring that I actually feel sad like if I were leaving my own family. But when I come home, Brian is so cheerful in welcoming me back that I feel he's more a friend that a concierge.

2/24/2016,Howard H.,-1,1.0,"It's amazing what a fair amount of terrible management will do, and how what seem to be a variety of conflicts of interest, all playing out behind the scenes, have marred what might have otherwise been a reasonably cool building in an amazing neighborhood.

I'd like to highlight some of the more recent trends and also explain what I understand to be their cause. It's hard to really know about cause given that almost none of what's actually going on is ever conveyed to the residents. Like so many things with 34 Berry, it's hard to discern the extent to which that's the result of deliberate obfuscation or simply an incapacity to articulate anything but the most simple of ideas.

NONEXISTENT MAINTENANCE
As alluded to in another Yelp review, the maintenance supervisor seems to be primarily interested in maintaining his interests, rather than those relating to the building and its residents. These include such things as failing to fix a light in the hallway for a long period. Ignoring endless scuff marks and scratches throughout nearly every surface of the building. Allowing the building wifi to be down for long periods. Never fixing a rickety cart. Rarely ever vacuuming the hallways and seemingly never repainting them. Removing carpeting from the elevators, supposedly so that staff have one less thing to clean. Allowing the wipes in the gym to run out and soap from bathroom soap dispensers to go unfilled, even after residents ask for them to be refilled. But then allowing his son to park cars in empty parking spots in the garage. Ensuring that staff have fancy new radios, which they seem to rarely ever use.

The general principle that seems to be applied is reminiscent of the MTA, repair nothing until it's broken, then if repairs are necessary do what is absolutely minimum to restore working status. The general image is of Boss Tweed, another great New Yorker.

STAFF TURNOVER AND CONFLICTS
The door staff have today started a petition of some kind to inform someone else in management about something that they are displeased about but which will affect residents. Whether this petition, if it really even is one, has any chance of impacting anything is unclear. What is clear, is that endless conflicts between building staff degrades the moral of the whole place and seems to create a general feeling of disharmony.

Instead of being greeted by staff who seem happy to be doing their job, the residents are greeted by staff who have a never ending, and ever changing, litany of grievances against their own management. The conflict is also now at a point where the hours of door staff are being minimized to the point that ever fewer services will be provided and provided to a lower quality. The regular staff are also being, perhaps temporarily, replaced by staff from other buildings. This outside staff is entirely unfamiliar with the building and its residents.

Within the last few years, there have been a variety of managers, each with their own good and bad qualities. Their turnover may or may not be a reflection of behind the scenes conflicts, the general theme. Whatever the case, there has been a near total lack of continuity. One manager supposedly didn't like people lounging in the first floor lounge and therefore deliberately allowed the television to go unrepaired for a long period. Another manager made everyone happy with social activities, but then left.

The current manager writes emails on occasion without signing his name. He usually seems to write them more or less as a reaction to something. One resident is upset about ash falling on to their terrace and everyone is then emailed about this. The emails then are long on patchy prescriptions and inane requests, or relevant chunks of legalese, but short on actual informed and balanced policy, such as what someone with a wealth of experience might generate. For what it's worth, his emails seemingly never miss an opportunity to apply a little marketing spin. Our apartments are not just apartments, but ""apartment homes"".

Door staff past and present have included some fantastic people who take great pride in their jobs. They have also included at least one who was often seen sleeping on the job, who some residents claimed was drunk on the job and who residents also claimed removed a Zipcar from the premises for his personal use. It was never made clear, at least to my knowledge, why he eventually left.

LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND/OR TOO MUCH ACCOUNTABILITY
Trivial requests are unnecessarily prolonged and made more difficult, as only certain staff can do certain things, and not all staff are aware of who can do what. This means those who can do things also take long, as they are already loaded up with many such requests, whereas staff who can't do things become increasingly apathetic, to the point of being unwilling to do much more than say that you will have to ask someone else.","Brooklyn, NY",0,1,N/A,0
3/15/2012,Rita W.,-1,3.0,"I like this building.  Friendly people, happy vibe, great location, decent space.  However, I have to say it looks better than what it actually is.  

They have washer and dryer in each unit, which is awesome.  But the washers and dryers break down all the time.  I have seen many units flooded out by the washers, including my very next door neighbor who told me how he survived the flood.  My washer so far hasn't created any accident, but it turns itself off half way all the time.  That means I can't just set it and leave the house, but instead have to stay and watch to make sure it is running til job is done.   And the dryers tend to have their own mind, either shut down unexpectedly, or never shut down (no matter how you set it) and burn the clothes (my $200 sheets ruined).  They got me a different dryer after that incident, but the new one broke down after a few months.  Now waiting for the 3rd one.

They have a dishwasher, which really helps if you are busy.  However, it doesn't do a good job, doesn't really clean the dishes.  I mean, I have used my mom's dishwasher before, and there's a HUGE difference as to the cleaning power.  I think my mom's dishwasher is more like ""normal"" quality.  The the ones here...not so good...

They have large good-looking refrigerators, but many of them make constant noises that drive me crazy.

I have been complaining, and the answer I received is that the machines are what they are, and they can only swamp the machines from empty apts or their other source of spare units, and see if I have any luck.  And I was told that if I don't have any luck, I should consider buying my own (including refrigerator).  Excuse me?  I am sorry, I am a very easy going person.   Everything else I can live with.  But a noisy refrigerator in a studio is a deal breaker.  I usually fall asleep easily, but this thing is giving me headaches and making me dream monsters who snore next to me during my sleep.

Come on!  With that crazy expensive monthly rent, can you at least get some real functional appliances!!

Absolutely no regard for other people and their customers, their homes, and their money!!!!!

9/14/2017,Donna G.,-1,1.0,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  This brokerage is extremely shady and does not follow legal business practices of the brokerage community.  They illegal advertise apartments as their own listings when they are in fact not.  My brother is a broker a let me in on the secret of what this terrible company is doing.  Apparently they have been reported for years for the shady business.  

I think they should be investigated and I would stay far away from them!   There are many other companies in NYC where they will tell you upfront and be honest and fair.  Always ask around for a referral and don't trust the lies you see on the internet.  

Highly unprofessional","New York, NY",0,6,N/A,0
4/7/2011,Drew A.,-1,1.0,"Where to start? I called on an 'apartment by owner' ad that was on craigslist and a few days later I got a call back from a guy named Mike who said the unit was rented but that he had another one I could see. So I thought, OK sure. I show up on some street corner and there is another person there to meet me, Kellyn, who while attractive and nice insisted that I sign a 'client agreement form' before I could see the apartment. I was a little thrown off by this since I had called on an OWNER ad and NOT A BROKER ad. But I had already come across town so I signed the stupid thing. We get in the apartment, and it was OK. Kellyn told me she worked with the owner, but that there was a 'low fee' on this particular unit, which didn't make sense to me. Why would the owner try to charge someone to rent his apartment? If they hadn't been so shady I probably would have rented the place but seeing the other feedback on them makes me happy I turned and ran away!","Manhattan, NY",0,1,N/A,0
3/31/2011,anne c.,-1,1.0,"Like many realtors in the NYC market I found City Wide Apartments to be shady. The agent Michaela Alexander charged me a fee for an apartment that I later found out was advertised as a 'no fee'/fee paid by the landlord. Additionally she tried to charge me a few hundred more than what the apartment was listed for online.

She also asked me for cash to cover the credit check. I later found out she charged me additional money in excess of the cost of the building's credit check fee. She is a crook and I would stay away from her and this company.

You're better off walking around town to find an apartment or trying some of the new no fee web sites than dealing with the many unscrupulous brokers in this city who do nothing for you and only see a big $$ sign stamped on your head.","Jersey City, NJ",0,4,N/A,0
4/7/2010,JT D.,-1,1.0,"We had a very dis-satisfactory experience with this Manhattan brokerage company.  Our first complaint is that they require a cash only deposit for application fees and do not provide receipts.  Eek!  That should have been the first red flag.  Our second complaint is the manner in which they practice real estate law in regards to tenants rights: in an effort to get us into one of their ""exclusive"" properties they asked us to put a person on the lease who would not be living in the unit, and then advised us to lie during the interview (for the apartment) about this person living in the unit (when they were only making themselves available to us as a Benefactor).  If you fall in love with one of their ""exclusive"" units, do a bit of research and contact the building's owner directly- or use another broker!","New York, NY",0,2,N/A,0
10/13/2013,Anna C.,-1,3.0,"Overall, City Wide Apartments served their purpose. We are in a great apartment. But this experience at the end, put a bad taste in our mouths:

The $3500 broker fee was high for us but we were tired of looking and Kristen (who we had a great experience with) made the process painless. We got three cashier's check ($8 fee per check) and went in excited to sign the lease and close.

Mike looked at the checks and told us we were short $300 on the broker's fee. We were surprised and unhappy to hear this. CityWide had given us the number for the broker fee before we got the cashier's checks and we didn't think we should absorb the cost of their mistake. Mike blamed Kristen, laughed at us for several minutes, and trivialized our concerns.

The excitement and satisfaction thinking we had made the right decision to work with Citywide completely dissipated. We reminded Mike that we were his clients and that his behavior was terribly rude and shitty customer service. Mike said he'd  ""send us a gift basket.""  

Obviously, we never expected a gift basket from Mike but I guess that's the point of this story- he's not that kind of guy. Would have been great had he cared enough to prove us wrong though.","New York, NY",1,8,1,0

Within a matter of a couple weeks Jeff helped us line up a great apartment, and with his guidance we were able to sign for it and have the process locked up so we could focus on the move.

2/13/2014,Maia B.,-1,4.0,"I recently worked with Cliff at City Wide Apartments to find a new apartment.  While we ultimately decided to move outside of the city for my wife's job, we had such a pleasant experience working with Cliff.  I have moved in the city several times and had had mediocre experiences until I met Cliff.  He was honest and upfront about everything throughout the process, even if it did not benefit him.  We even liked an apartment that he showed us on Carmine Street in the West Village and debated putting in an application on the place until Cliff informed us that the apartment had previously had bedbugs.  Not only was Cliff upfront about this, but he even took the time to look up this information online.  In case you aren't familiar with real estate agents in Manhattan, that is unheard of!  Once we let Cliff know that we would be moving out of the city after all, rather than just move onto the next client he decided to offer a lending hand with our move if we needed.  

Beyond Cliff himself, it was clear that agents at City Wide are able to use a wide variety of resources to keep clients happy.  If Cliff did not know the answer to a question that I asked, he was very quick to call a manager and find out correct details hastily.  There was an apartment that could only be seen at a very specific time where Cliff was unavailable.  In just a few minutes he had me lined up to see the apartment with one of his colleagues, Michael, who shared the same professional integrity that I had experienced with Cliff.  I truly felt that City Wide and I were on the same team throughout this process rather than the typical ""client vs broker"" relationship that I had previously experienced.  I wholeheartedly recommend Cliff and City Wide to anyone looking for a real estate agent in the city; what a refreshing experience.","Manhattan, NY",0,1,N/A,0

The events of the world over the past two years forced me to move relocate; and even amidst these volatile times, one of their team (Mo) still found the time to contact me directly. The call wasn't a mere follow-up, but a genuine reaching-out to see how I was doing, what my NYC experience had been and how they could be of assistance on any level moving forward. It's easy to become delegated to ""just a number"" status within the city's Real Estate scene, and it means a lot when a business operates outside of this paradigm.

I was faced with the challenge of terminating a lease 6 months early right when Covid hit and Nyi Nyi successfully helped me navigate the entire process.  Some big obstacles Nyi Nyi overcame for me:

-Virtual and in person showings with Covid safety protocols.
-Renegotiating a lower monthly rate with my huge (and difficult) management company.
-Negotiating my management to add a free month to incentivize demand.
-Ultimately found someone to take over a very expensive lease during a time when no one wanted to live in NYC.

All in all, Nyi Nyi's hard work saved me thousands of dollars I would have otherwise owed to my landlord. On top of being super proficient professionally, Nyi Nyi is a very pleasant and cool guy who was fun to work with.

Thanks to Nyi Nyi and City Wide Apartments for all the help.

10/29/2019,Ryn E.,-1,5.0,"I just moved to New York from Virginia. I had originally found a roommate and we began looking for apartment all over the city together. We found an apartment we loved (City Wide Apartment), so we decided to put an application down. The broker I was in contact with, Tomi, was incredible. Once we finally had all the paperwork in for this apartment, my roommate up and left the country; leaving me with no roommate and an open application. I spoke with Tomi on the phone and expressed to her how desperately I needed this apartment due to my new job was starting that next week. She explained to me my options and was empathetic towards the issue at hand. I scrambled to find another roommate and was able to find someone to take the second room within 12 hours (a miracle!). I put the new roommate and Tomi in contact and things started to fall into place again. At this point Tomi had been extremely on top of all concerns and questions regarding the apartment; every text, call and email-- any hour. The day we were supposed to sign the lease, the agreement I had with my guarantor fell apart. It became incredibly difficult, frustrating, and overcomplicated. All the while Tomi was willing to do whatever it was going to take to continue to help me get this apartment. Words cannot express how grateful I am to have worked with Tomi. I encountered some horrible brokers throughout my apartment search (not associated with City Wide). Tomi wasn't in it for the money involved, there wasn't even a brokers fee for the apartment. She really cared about helping someone who clearly needed it. There isn't another broker out there who would've gone to the extent that Tomi went to help me. There is such value in personal interaction that is forgotten many times. Tomi truly went above and beyond and deserves, at the very least, the highest praise for being so great at her job.

7/24/2019,Nick D.,-1,5.0,"I don't usually write yelp reviews, but I felt like City Wide and my broker, Nyi Nyi, in particular deserved it. We all know moving in NYC can be a hassle and rental agencies and brokers can be notoriously unforthcoming and difficult to work with. The complete opposite is true of my experience. Nyi Nyi showed me the apartment and was very clear about its features, rental policies, and broker agreements. He was upfront about any application fees and broker fees before we even set foot in the apartment.

Often times after being shown a good apartment, you're overwhelmed with the feeling of panic as the race to get all your documents in order before the other 20 people seeing the same apartment. Nyi Nyi put that concern to bed by asking me to be direct about my intention to rent the apartment and once I did that, he stopped showing it to other renters and very expeditiously helped us gather the necessary paperwork. He was very flexible with my out of state roommate working remotely and with the need for certain documents which are difficult to obtain at a moment's notice. Nyi Nyi was available by phone at basically all hours of the day or night and was very honest and straightforwardly responsive to questions.

I've dealt with around 20 brokers over the years in NYC and he's by far the most trustworthy and helpful. As a client, he took feedback from what I wanted and worked hard to find me exactly what I was looking for even though it was hard to find - and ended up doing even better! No bait and switching, no being pushy just to get to the next client. Plus his exclusive listings are in some of the better landlord buildings that don't raise rent often, with great supers (surprisingly hard to find, it turns out). Then a few years later when I was a tenant and he was showing my apartment, he was always extremely respectful of my time, communicated with me regularly about what was going on, and helped me coordinate with the new tenant. In an environment where most brokers are shady, he's trustworthy. That alone is all you need to know.","New York, NY",231,1,N/A,0

I luckily came across a posting on StreetEasy for a perfect apartment within my budget in a great neighborhood in NoLita so reached out to Anne Kuzbik for a viewing. As I travel during the week for work, it was very difficult to arrange timings to come see the unit but Anne was beyond accommodating and made it work for me. The apartment was exactly what I was looking for so I immediately moved forward with my application process and started gathering the necessary paperwork. Anne helped make this process seamless and easy for me, clearly outlining everything that I needed to send and forms that needed to be executed. She also worked around my difficult schedule to coordinate the logistics and help me get the unit that I wanted. Once confirmed and accepted for the apartment, she has helped me every step of the way with my move...from helping to coordinate my actual move, measuring and sending me the measurements for the unit and connecting me to the property management company.

He not only took my bf and I on a well-planned tour to see places in a variety of neighborhoods, but was incredibly responsive and patient throughout the whole process (and I really tend to overthink things and send too many emails).

We gave ourselves a month to find an apartment, but Jeramiah really has his ear to the ground and found us the perfect spot in less than a week. AND negotiated for us, AND acted as a seamless mediator between us and the building management, AND was there for us when the building wanted a thousand different documents (yes, applying for an apartment in NY is like applying for a mortgage anywhere else). Each time I was worried we wouldn't get approved or something wouldn't work out, Jeramiah would keep us optimistic.

I contacted CityWide through a friend of a friend who had an amazing experience finding a place only a year earlier. I was set up with Ryan Saxton...he's WONDERFUL!! That Friday we looked at 7 or 8 different places, all of which were right in line with what I was looking for. I ended up signing papers that day to get the process started on my apartment...which I love...then jumped on a plane back to Atlanta. Ryan was extremely helpful throughout the whole process. Since everything post the choosing of the apartment was done with me being out of state, Ryan played a huge role in making sure that the process went smoothly and that everything was taken care of without issue. He even went back to my apartment after all the paperwork went through to take more pictures and measurements for me. The best of the best! I highly recommend Ryan and CityWide!!","Manhattan, NY",93,1,N/A,0

""Collin Medford and the CWA team for all of your real-estate needs""

There's nothing more nerve-wracking and stressful than apartment hunting in New York, a process made all the worse by impatient or greedy or straight up rude brokers. Thankfully, there's no need to lose faith in humanity or give up the search for that perfect apartment, because there's Collin. He helped us secure a dream apartment at the last minute, negotiating with the owners on our behalf and going well above and beyond anything I would've expected from a broker.

He was incredibly knowledgeable about the neighborhood, very quick to respond to messages, and remarkably good at moving the process forward without being a pushy salesman, and-- throughout it all-- was so relatable, friendly, and cheerful, he was more like a friend than a broker. Once the paperwork was handled, Collin even came back to help measure rooms and layout the apartment with us - just awesome service.

Collin is entirely in a field of his own. He is, quite simply, the best in the business and we will be using him for years to come.

Thanks!","Bellmore, NY",323,1,N/A,0

10/17/2015,Gabrielle S.,-1,5.0,"After reading a review by ""MC"" recently in the City Wide YELP feed, which was brought to my attention by someone I referred to City Wide, I felt compelled to write a review of my own (although I do not normally use  as a place to air grievances or bestow compliments).

I recently worked with one of the brokers at City Wide named Cliff who along with the management team there was completely transparent, honest and diligent in his efforts to assist me.  I was able to find, with his help, an apartment for my family at a price within my budgetary constraints and was charged a reasonable fee for the service provided (well below what I have paid through other brokers).

Additionally, it is noteworthy that Cliff did not waste any of my time.  He was able to locate and schedule apartments for me to view apartments within a few hours of me contacting him, one of which I rented as it met and in some cases exceeded my requirements/expectations.

It can be a jungle out there in the city trying to find an apartment; City Wide is one company you can really trust to help you find a new place to call home.

I would not believe every negative review you read .. there are lots of crazy people in New York.","Manhattan, NY",0,3,N/A,0

We worked with Owen McCafferty and it went really smoothly! He was constantly available via email texting or phone calls. My roommates and I were all working full time so he was really accommodating to our schedules. It was our first apartment in the city so we didn't really know what we were doing or what documents we needed. He walked us through the whole process and helped us put together our application packet. He was even nice enough to walk our parents through the guarantor's forms since they had never filled one out.

My broker, Jessica, was extremely personable, friendly and understanding of my situation. Not only did she show me a number of great apartments but went out of her way to answer my questions at any time of day with immediate and helpful service. My situation was unique in the fact that I am Canadian with no American credit score or American guarantor - needless to say it added quite a challenge to find a landlord that would accept me as a tenant.

Fast forward to 2014, and I needed a new place. I called up City Wide Apartments again, gave them my requirements, and a few weeks later they found me another fully renovated apartment matching all my requirements.

Worked with owner Mike J. and broker Eric E. I highly recommend these guys.","Denver, CO",5,5,8,0

My roommate and I weren't sure whether we wanted to live in Manhattan or Brooklyn, and thankfully Michael was willing and able to help us look in both areas.  

We ended up taking a place in Midtown East that he recommended.  Once we moved in, we realized lucky we were to have Michael's advice.  The apartment completely exceeded our expectations once our second bedroom was partitioned (this was a 1 bedroom converted to a 2 bedroom).  Our friends can't believe how lucky we got!

We told Jeff what type of apartment and he was able to show us spaces that fit our budget and all of our criteria and got us a great deal! The apartment was completely gutted when we first looked at it but Jeff assured us of the process and end result. He went to the apartment to check on it during construction and constantly kept us in the loop.

2/9/2014,Robyn M.,-1,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Jeff R from City Wide Apartments and couldn't have been more pleased. My son and his friend had worked with a different broker/agency and were all set to move into a NY apartment they found. Four days before their scheduled move in date, I asked this ""other"" broker via email a question on a sentence or two in the contract about my being a guarantor and I also asked if the boys could expect whatever was broken in the apartment to be fixed within 2 weeks from the move in date. This same broker said the building owner no longer wanted to rent the apartment to the 2 boys and that in the future they should just ""sign the lease and not ask any questions."" This left me in total shock as my son's friend had already given notice to his landlord and literally would have no where to live in 4 days. I looked frantically on line and found good reviews for City Wide. I called and was told not to worry and that they would send me a list of available units for immediate move in within an hour or two. True to their word, the list came and the next day Jeff R showed us 3 nice apartments. I cannot say enough nice things about working with Jeff R. That same day, we signed paperwork and the next day they were approved and moved in on time. He was directly responsible for finding the apartment and following up with all the details to be sure everything went smoothly. He found them a wonderful apartment, within budget and in a much better neighborhood than where they were originally going to move into.

Mary knew the ins and out of all the neighborhoods and was very professional.  Not only did she help us with our search she was so easy to talk to and really cared about helping us find the right place within our budget.

He quickly figured out what I was looking for, and managed to find me an apartment with everything I wanted and more. Better yet, it was actually in my price range. I honestly don't know what I would have done without Jeff and the team at City Wide. They made apartment hunting a pleasure, and helped streamline the lease application process.

This time moving, I knew that I would most likely have to go through a broker, and, based on the stories my friends had told, was not looking forward to the experience. After seeing a few apartments, my roommate and I started a game of picking out brokers and clients on the street - spotting the brokers was usually pretty easy, and most of them weren't people that we particularly wanted to pay to let us into an apartment. When we met Mary from City Wide, we were expecting the same type of thing, but she surprised us by being a down to earth, non-sketchy, normal person.

Mary showed us the apartment that we had responded to - the actual apartment, not a tiny, old apartment that looked nothing like the pictures in the ad. She explained what we had already begun to figure out - that a 3 bedroom downtown in our budget was hard to find - and we ended up applying that day. Mary helped us prepare the best application possible, and was even able to negotiate a lower fee for us (even though I'm assuming that cost her money).

The apartments are very spacious and clean, and they have beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows. There is a lot of natural sunlight, which is hard to find! The units also have a good amount of closet space. The floors were not overcrowded, and I rarely heard my neighbors. The rooftop has a beautiful 360 view of the city and the community events in the building organized by Atlas and Gotham Concierge were very fun! These events included an outdoor concert series, cocktail / whiskey tasting, cooking demos, and fun events for kids and pets. The gym has a lot of equipment and the exercise classes were really good. Pierre Fils-Aime's Circuit and Bootcamp classes were incredible (even better than classes at my gym) and he helped create a great community.  

During the pandemic, the staff has gone above and beyond. They cleaned the elevators and common areas multiple times a day, delivered packages and food to people's doors if they got sick, and were extremely helpful.

The onsite staff at Atlas are A+, and everyone at the front desk is just fantastic. Could not ask for nicer people. During COVID, I felt like staff and management went above and beyond to keep things sanitized and orderly, and we really appreciated their hard work. Building mgmt was quick to respond to emails and on the rare occasions we've had to have something fixed, the response has been fast. The only downside I experienced was the laundry room being out of service for an extended period of time, but that was more of a city DOB issue than an Atlas issue so I don't hold it against them.

The building itself is nice, with the 360 rooftop being it's main selling point. Apts have ample closet space which is appreciated. The gym is good, the yoga classes offered were awesome, and all in all it's been a very nice building to live in. Before COVID, they would also do seasonal events too which were cute. I would definitely recommend Atlas to anyone apt searching around that neighborhood.","Brooklyn, NY",0,22,N/A,0

The facilities are clean, the staff have been transparent and diligent since the COVID-19 crisis started, and overall you can tell that Atlas (and by extension, Gotham) have taken everyone's safety and health very seriously. They clean frequently and the building residents have been respectful as well. The staff are extremely helpful, quick, and go above and beyond! They have a great policy that allows you to upgrade in the middle of your lease without penalty, so when we decided to move into a bigger place they made the process seamless. They were accommodating with the lease start date, since we had to travel back from visiting family out-of-state, despite having other interested renters. It's been a pleasure working with them! Don't hesitate to move in! Also, anything you need in the city is steps away.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

6/10/2020,Dave P.,-1,5.0,"Lived here for 9 years and loved it. The staff, in partiularly the doormen and porters are both professional and helpful, yet with a sense of fun, so it doesnt feel 'stuffy'. The apartments are standard NYC apartments, and as the building is so tall, many of them have amazing views.
Common areas are well maintained and clean, the gym is small but has most things you need, and rarely crowded - they also offer a number of classes, from yoga to cardio burn.
The Rooftop is amazing! 47 stories high, so the views are incredible, and MUCH better than most of the other available rooftop bars in the city. Equipped with sun loungers, as well as tables so a great place to take your dinner in the evening.
Finally location couldnt be more central - A 5 minute walk from the QNRW, 123, BDFM lines, 15 min walk to Grand Central and Trader Joes, 10 to Penn and Times Square, 3 minutes from Bryant Park & Whole Foods etc. Yes, there are a lot of people around, but this is Manhattan - what do you expext?! Also makes for a feeling of safety - both around the building and inside.

The move in was also painless as the Atlas team were flexible over elevator times, and were very helpful.

I met Olivia at the leasing office and she took time to show me around the building and describe the amenities (gym, great roof and even breakfast every morning). I then disappeared for a month, looking for other options. When I came back, Olivia was just as charming and showed me few more apartments. I had a hard date to leave my current place, and the apartment I really liked was in renovation. Olivia pulled strings so that the workers complete the renovation on time. In the days that followed, I came with a tap measure half a dozen times (before I signed a contract) and Olivia took me to the apartment patiently and with a smile. Now that I signed a lease and am ready to move in next week, I hope that the rest of the stuff in the Atlas is just as helpful and charming as Olivia.","Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

The actual floorspace of the apartment is very generous compared to the other apartments I looked at prior to coming here, at comparable cost. The staff on the front desk are also incredibly helpful.

The Atlas is not only a beautiful building with beautiful amenities and views. It is most of all a great community to live in.

The team, comprised of handymen, porters and front-desk attendants, is truly the best I've ever witnessed.

They really take the concept of customer service to a higher level, to the extent that we often felt like we were living in a five-start hotel instead of a NYC rental building.

Our experience was so great we now moved to another property from Gotham simply because we feel like we cant bear any other level of service/experience than the one we've been accustomed to.

I visit very often as I am transitioning moving to NYC myself and looking for a building. Most buildings dont get back to me when i call or email, but the leasing office here gets back to you very fast. They were really helpful and answered all my questions and always got back to me when i had a question.

My favorite part here is the roof. The roof alone makes this place worth living in. Unlike most buildings, you dont get the loud obnoxious party crowd. The tenants are very respectful and nice.

I was warmly welcomed by the front desk staff every day (shout out to Tom for always being extremely helpful) as well as Maintenance or whoever was in the building working.  Any maintenance requests were quickly followed up on and the leasing staff did a great job at prompty returning my deposit when I unfortunately had to move to the midwest.  I worked mostly with Liza and she was very attentive and professional.

There are constantly people smoking cigarettes and marijuana in the hallways and staircases.  There's gum on the walls - someone even peed in an elevator.  My apartment always smells like marijuana - no matter how long I have a candle burning.  Management does absolutely nothing to curb this behavior. In fact, if you call them, they do not answer and if you email them they don't respond. There are people playing loud music at all hours, dogs barking...

3/3/2021,Karla S.,-1,2.0,"The building is beautiful and the views are great. My issue with this building and the reason I am moving out is the management team. They really don't do anything to help and tend to complicate things. They never made me feel like they were on ""my side"" and considering the extremely high rents, residents should be treated way better. Whenever I asked what my options were to break my lease he said   ""I don't believe you and the excuses I've read so far. You can stay until your lease expires or pay me a large sum to consider breaking your contract.  You problem, not mine."" It truly sucks to be treated this way, they are very aggressive and only care about money and not the happiness of residents. The gym management team also has very strange rules that end up negatively affecting residents.

12/30/2020,Stephanie G.,-1,1.0,"I've been a tenant here for under a year and will not be resigning my lease. While the location is convenient and amenities are nice, I would never recommend to anyone. Even the low rates they seem to be advertising to new tenants, is not worth the hassle of actually living here. Management is the worst I've ever dealt with - extremely hard to get in touch with despite various attempts through multiple channels, and when you can they are impatient and lack respect. They are incredibly unwilling to accommodate, from large issues, like rent rates and tenant concerns, to amenity requests and usage. The rooftop is one of the best I've seen in lower Manhattan, but good luck ever getting to use it. Even on special occasions (NYE, birthdays, etc), management refuses to let tenants use it in the evenings. Why are we paying for amenities that we can't use?

There are plenty of other apartments in the area, offering better rates and above average management. Rockrose in less than desirable and no one deserves that kind of treatment, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.

The one star is for the building staff. I actually have really come to appreciate the doorman, they are all very polite and personable. They are the real heroes of 200 Water.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0
5/12/2017,Anne R.,-1,1.0,"Avoid it, it is a nightmare!  I would give it no star if I had that choice!  The rooftop is as great as everyone says it is BUT it doesn't make living there worth it. Why? The building overcrowded with many students, which means crowded elevators, gym and loud neighbors. Honestly only 2 elevators out of 4 work. doesn't matter east side or west side..both same. sometimes had to wait 15 mins for elevators. I could hear the neighbors having sex and you can hear the partying throughout the unit when it's down the halls, as well as the sounds slamming doors, yelling,... They are college students and they yell all the time in lobby or hallways. I lived in upper level(floor 20) but still could hear cars on street even when the windows were closed. So, basically the walls are super thin! The gym is busy during rush hours, dry cleaning is expensive. Yeah, it's the worst place I have EVER lived. Hopefully I moved out few months ago. Also, even the doorman are so rude and angry! they are not well trained! they act like college students..This building is very expensive and a big disaster.","New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0

Not only did they charge an extra month of rent for the month AFTER our lease ended but they refused to rectify the mistake when we accidentally paid it. Additionally, the security deposit takes forever to get back and they are constantly sending rude emails to the entire building about noise, holidays, roof regulations, etc. If you want to feel like you're living with Big Brother watching over you go ahead, otherwise rent somewhere else.","New York, NY",0,1,N/A,0
7/12/2011,David L.,-1,1.0,"The location is great, the staff on location are great.  It's the company, Rockrose, that is unbelievably awful.  First, the structure of the building is terrible, as it leaks in our apartment every time it rains.  The maintenance staff has done patchwork every time.  Only to have it leak again.  What else can they do?  They'd have to tear into the actual infrastructure, but Rockrose would rather have our extremely high rent instead of fixing it for good.  That would cost money and make a tenant happy.

Second, they'll offer you a great introductory rate to get you in, then jack up your rent when you try to renew your lease.  Great way to reward loyalty.  This is on top of their building falling under rent control laws, but they're disputing the courts finding because that would mean they can't price gouge anymore.  They got a huge tax break for development, and they want more of your money too.

Third, every morning the elevators and common areas are littered with bottles, cans, and even partially eaten cheeseburgers because many tenants treat the place like a garbage dump.  Not really Rockrose's fault, but they can easily prevent this.  Great rooftop too, but good luck trying to get your guests up there with their extremely strict ""tenants only"" policy, which they implement whenever they feel like it with little warning via extremely rude security guards.

Short story, don't rent there unless Rockrose sells the place to another company that will actually respect you.","PECK SLIP, NY",0,2,N/A,0
2/8/2011,Anna A.,-1,1.0,"Terrible heating system and BAD privacy!

I am currently living in the building and feel lucky that I will move out in weeks. My terrible experience is in this freezing winter. My air conditioning stopped working normally about a month ago when the extremely cold weather started.

I have so far reported at least 8 times. The super kept coming in. But still it hadn't worked normally. I got a cold twice in this whole process and I even warned them that it was required by NY law to provide heat to tenants. But still...

A week ago, after I called so many times and told them if they didn't fix it within 3 days, I might sue them. The air-conditioning finally started working after they did sth. I got my normal life back.

However, the story didn't end there. Today just after I came back home, I found my air-conditioning turned off and appearantly someone had entered my room. And I called to check with the front desk. They said they were not aware of anyone coming in my room.

But after my roomie came back, she told me someone did come in to fix my air-conditioning which had been fixed a week ago already!!! And after he ""fixed"" it, it STOPPED working normally again!!!

This is rediculous! And when I called front desk, the guy didn't want to talk to me and asked me to call main office between 8 AM and 4 PM. What's wrong with them!! We most people need to work full-time!! And many of us are super busy during day-time...

I don't know what I can do. I may catch a cold again...

And my roommate also complained to me the other day, when I was not home, the leasing office people directly let people come in to see our apartment without permission!! What if I left some of my expensive necklace, rings on the table and some confidential information there!!

4/25/2017,Nikki W.,-1,2.0,"Lived there a year and didn't run into any major problems. That said, there was a lot of stuff you shouldn't have to put up with for the cost.

Pros
- Some of the friendliest doormen ever
- Unbeatable location. The seaport is fantastic and you can run along the water
- Dog park right by and a pet friendly building. Lots of cute pups
- One of the cheaper buildings with doormen and amenities in the area (maybe manhattan?)
- Close enough to subways
- Easy repairs in your unit happen pretty quickly
- Beautiful views from the roof

Cons
- Management is incredibly rude and difficult to communicate with after you move in
- They say it used to be an NYU dorm. It never stopped.
- The elevators are constantly broken. There are supposed to be 3 but they've never all been working in the past year. You're lucky if 2 are. Gets really slow in rush times.
- Nasty plumbing issues. Brown stuff coming out of the sink, and our kitchen sink backs up into our tub. Heard this happens to other tenants as well. Management doesn't fix it.
- The gym has a single window and crappy AC, and the treadmills are constantly broken

10/30/2015,Karina M.,-1,5.0,"I have lived in this building for approx 6 years.

The building:
I love it. The building management team recently decided to renovate, and although it was a little inconvenient - the building looks brand new again. The walls are a little thin, and I can sometimes hear my neighbors. Thankfully one of my neighbors moved out - she was particularly loud and obnoxious - but thankfully she moved out. This is not unlike any other large dwelling.
I have never lived in another building that is this CLEAN. The hallways get vaccumed, the garbage disposal areas on each floor are cleaned daily. I have not seen one roach - the entire time I've lived here. (SERIOUSLY, NOT ONCE!) THAT IS FANTASTIC.
The building is PET FRIENDLY. So there's plenty of dogs to greet you in elevators.

Gym / Laundry room /Lounge were all renovated recently. And the gym itself is very busy during peak hours, but you can generally find the right time to go.

The roofdeck is phenomenal - the views are amazing.

The staff:
From the building manager, to doormen, to maintenance and cleaning - everyone has been wonderful. They even helped me when I moved apartments (within the building)! I have been there for a while and I know most of the staff personally at this point. They are all super professional and always helpful.
The building staff respond to all requests almost immediately and if possible most are resolved within a day or two.

The rent:
The rent has been steadily going up, but the maximum allowed (4-5% a year) - sadly my salary doesn't grow at the same pace. The rents are rising way too quickly all around the city.

SANDY:
The handling of the Sandy hurricane and its aftermath was fantastic. Yes - I was displaced for the month after, but unlike other buildings in the area - the building management sent daily updates of the ongoing progress. AND the rent was waived for the time the tenants were displaced. They also offered a fridge cleaning service - for free - since many people left in a hurry. Bravo!","New York, NY",0,3,N/A,0

1/14/2017,Ally W.,-1,4.0,"We moved to NY to complete my residency at Maimonides Medical Center.  When we first moved to the building, it was heavily under construction.  It was a total eyesore, filled with banging and construction day and night.  Problematic plumbing, non-working heating units; which caused my husband to get very sick and suffer pneumonia our first winter at 66 Rockwell.  There were a host of problems that caused many of the residents to move out. These were all reasons for us to move out as well and not renew our lease when our lease expired. However, we did renew our lease at that time because through all the issues and inconveniences, we felt appreciated and our concerns were heard and addressed empathetically.

As time went by and management changed, there remained only a few friendly faces. Carlene, Megan, and Enis. I learned through the building staff there was a new property manager.  I recently began having issues with my rent payment account and wanted to speak with him/her to address it.  I was given the property manager's email and name, and I sent an email introducing myself and the problem I was having.  I received a response several days later where the property manager's response was ""Carlene will contact you by the end of the day to address your concern"" as well as ""I have an open door policy, please stop by at any time.""  I took up the offer to stop by the office since I was at home that day to meet her. I was pleasantly greeted by Carlene and waited for what I thought would be the property manager come out of her office to meet me. There is music that plays in the office and ironically as the music ended, I heard as clear as the view on a sunny country field, the property manager saying ""I ain't got time for that shit, you figure it out."" I could not believe what I heard.  Is this how the property manager treated the people who live and pay thousands of dollars in the building? Is this the way the property manager speaks to the staff? I only figured since I was home and in the building that I would go into the office to ask about the rent issues. What happened to the open door policy? I was shocked but I am glad I went in unexpectedly.

I left and went directly to the front desk to ask for the boss's contact information. However this information was not available and unknown.  It seems most of the staff in the building are very concerned about getting fired because it the property manager has a record of firing and bullying others.  I would not feel content to know I may cause any staff at Rockwell to be fired so I did not push the issue anymore.  What I did do is not renew my lease.  I will not spend another dollar in a building where the property manager is rude.

The building is beautiful (5 stars). The front desk staff are always professional and has never been a disappointment. Enis, the building cannot survive without you.  Carlene you genuine and have always been understanding and great.  Joshua you need to be a little more understand and not so presumptuous.  Desique, I admire your creativity.

I am usually not a morning person but am immediately cheered up by their ""Good morning and have a good day"". Enis in maintenance is phenomenal as well, he immediately diagnoses issues and works rapidly to resolve them. He is responsive and patient I.e showing me how to properly open and lock the patio door"". The building is phenomenal from the sky lounge which provides you with breathtaking views and the amenities within the club lounge. All in all the apartment building and community is phenomenal I am so excited that I made this decision","Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,N/A,0

There is everything from a coffee kiosk to a sky lounge, a gym, and even a game room! You can host private events in your very own apartment. Everyone from your neighbors to the staff are always willing to help out and are like family. Definitely if you're checking out places to live you should come here.","Irvine, CA",418,25,10,0

12/10/2017,Adriana N.,-1,5.0,"We are well into our second year of living at 66 Rockwell, and (like many others) have only great things to say about this building. My boyfriend started out in a studio here, and a year later, we moved into our 1-bedroom - we are really excited to embrace another year here, where you will never feel alone because it truly feels like home!

First of all, the location is marvellous - blocks away from several trains, so you always have options. All of the stops are a 5 minute walk (or less) depending on where you need to go.

The concierge and maintenance personnel are always available, always helpful, and always kind. If you put in a request or need a hand with anything at all, your issue is often resolved right away, if not, soon after. I can always count on any member of building to give a hand when need be.

The building amenities are always functioning and open for use (the coffee shop on a Sunday is the greatest gift we could ask for!!) not to mention the several events they host throughout the month: movie nights, gym classes, comedy shows, book club, cooking classes... the list can go on and on.

Rent is fair for what you receive back and you will LOVE coming home to your space. Apartment views are beautiful and even studios are incredibly spacious. Highly, highly recommend living at 66 Rockwell :)","Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,N/A,0

As soon as I got a tour of 66 Rockwell I knew it was a perfect fit for me! It's in a great location, close to several subway lines and only 3 miles away from lower Manhattan.

Definitely the best place we've lived in NYC. We saw a couple of units in the building before we moved in, and they were all spacious and bright with tons of natural sunlight and had incredible views. Not to mention enough counter space in the kitchen to cook and entertain! Common areas that you actually want to hang out in, a gym that's never crowded, and a skylounge on the roof with a spectacular view of the city. Highly recommend.","Brooklyn, NY",0,1,N/A,0

After growing tired with the noise and crowds of Manhattan and decided to become a Brooklynite and moved to 66 Rockwell Place in August 2017. Since moving into the building I feel at home. The Doormen are all kind, pleasant, helpful and go out of their way to accommodate you. Enis the building manager is always on top of any request that you make and is quick to respond. The building is luxurious and has large common spaces with friendly neighbors that enjoy interacting as part of a community. Overall I grade it as 5/5.

12/6/2017,Sruthi L.,-1,5.0,"Hands down one of the best buildings I've lived in (and I've tried everything from independently owned tiny apartment to other fancy condos). I first came across the building when I visited my boyfriend at the time while he lived there 3 years ago, and I eventually moved in. Throughout, the folks at the concierge have been efficient and courteous without being invasive, and I can say the experience is exactly the same 3 years later. They deal with packages, unexpected visitors, me leaving my straightening iron on (!!) uncomplainingly.
The management team has been responsive the community directors come up with creative ways to bring the people in the building together, and of course, Enis (the building manager) is usually attending to the problem within the hour if anything goes wrong.
All in all, 66 Rockwell makes for easy living, especially with the amazing views of the Statue of Liberty and Manhattan!","Durham, NC",8,12,N/A,0

There is a gym (with a few classes), arcade, poker room, rooftop -- basically everything you could ask for (minus a swimming pool). My main regret is that I don't take advantage of the amenities enough! They even deliver packages directly to your apartment while you are at work.

Overall, I would definitely recommend 66 Rockwell to anyone looking for a great apartment in Downtown Brooklyn.","New York, NY",169,1,N/A,0

The front desk concierge is really the cream of the crop: funny, genuine and personable - they always have time to chat if you want to :) I personally appreciate the warm ""hello"" and smile that greets me every morning, evening, and any time in-between (cheers Chris, Angel, Melanie and Daniel!)

Jamel, Marcus, and the other porters - thanks for being friendly, pleasant and always helping out with a smile.

Also thanks to Enis, who makes sure everything at the building is running smoothly (and if it's not, he makes sure to address issues as soon as he's able to). The urgency and attention to detail is appreciated by everyone in the building.","Brooklyn, NY",2,1,N/A,0

All of the staff are incredibly nice and accommodating. Alex our rental agent was genuinely interested in making our move in smooth and easy. The approval process wasn't the intrusive and intimidating process we're used to where our financial history and privacy are infringed. It was actually a very delightful process. We liked that the building sources from Brooklyn small businesses, and that its a blend of market rate and affordable units. The resident manager Enis and head concierge Chris, as well as Melanie, Angel, Marcus, Jamel, and one guy whom I'm forgetting his name that works the desk at night -- all really great people willing to help everyone out with any issue. Priya at the coffee window is so pleasant. The concierge dry cleaning people are amazing too. Can't say enough about these folks and the building itself.
