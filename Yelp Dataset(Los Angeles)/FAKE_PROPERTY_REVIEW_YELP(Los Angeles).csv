She is hands down amazing! She made this whole ordeal easy, and worth it, and even after a year being here she is still willing to help and go the extra mile to make sure living here is comfortable!","Wilshire Center, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,N/A,0
1/13/2017,Natasha M.,-1,5.0,"I lived at the Ancelle for the past year and a half.  As a professor I was looking for an artistic and professional building. The apartment building manager Leticia Lopez is amazing. She always attends to fixing things promptly and goes out of her way to ensure a positive, safe and professional culture.

During my time there she was truly a highlight of my experience. Her attention to detail and redesign of the formerly drab lobby made the entrance warm and inviting every night upon coming home. Her standard of excellence is superior to many apartment managers I have interacted with from NYC to the west coast.

3/15/2019,Vesna L.,-1,1.0,"Absolutely horrible experience. Do not listen to the ones who said it is amazing place to live. The safety system is a nightmare, and there were random people knocking on our doors at night. You can't find any security cameras anywhere. The packages are missing all the time, and I have given up on receiving any packages here. The property management team don't know what they are doing , and says they have ""new poilcy"" whenever they want. Really hard to get maintenance. The parking is a total mess. On good thing about it is that you are a party animal, and too bad if you want to sleep at night--expect parties at 2 am every weekend.","Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,N/A,0

7/5/2020,Keosily N.,-1,1.0,"Poor management.  
I had to break the lease and move out of this hellish place as soon as I could, for the sake of my young daughter.
The list is long: We could smell neighbors smoking cigarettes and marijuana inside building (although landlord the right to prohibit  tenants from smoking in a rental property) Another neighbor was having a loud party, until 3am. Police had to come to stop them. Rude people at common spaces threatening my daughter.
All these I reported to the apartment management but they didn't take any considerable action, so  I pleaded to break the lease so my family could move to a safe place.   They showed no mercy.  
They had another tenant who moved in after me without lapse, but they still collected the penalty and took a huge chunk of my security deposit during COVID-19.  Greedy!
Lame management and unsafe places to live, especially for families.","Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,N/A,0

Clean, smells good, amenities is very good.

6/23/2016,Kaylee T.,-1,5.0,"The staff at 3033 Wilshire are amazing.  Since the actual building is under construction, I had to visit the temp leasing office in the building next door.  It is unfortunate that the building is no where near compared to the actual office.  As you step in, it is just completely a different atmosphere.  You feel like a true VIP.  The entire staff stood up and greeted me.  You don't get that anywhere in Koreatown.  Jennifer, Sean, and Christine gave me all the information needed for me to understand their perks.  Best thing that stood out to me is their rooftop pool with a 360 view of the city.  AMAZING!!!!  I'll definitely be leasing from them once I'm out of my lease.

8/5/2021,Amy T.,-1,1.0,"As a potential new move in to the Los Angeles area, you'd think the leasing office would be very welcoming and open to answering questions. This was not the case; the lady who answered my call had a disgusting attitude and was unwilling to offer any insight nor willingness to answer any of my questions. Instead she was basically in a hurry to hang up after I voiced to her that I've been trying to contact this leasing office for over 3 weeks. And when I kept asking my questions to clarify what she meant, all she did was repeat the same thing over like a broken record. Keep in mind, I've reached out through the website message board, email, text and phone calls multiple times. This behavior makes me question if this is how they treat potential new tenants, how do they treat their existing tenants. Save your time, money and efforts; if they not willing to help you before even applying, what makes you think they'd actually help you when you live there.","SoMa, San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

The front office staff were always professional and helpful. The maintenance staff were always around and would complete my service requests within hours. Everyone staff member here are beyond friendly. The facilities were well maintained and have been upgraded several times while I was staying there. During the pandemic time, hand sanitizers and sanitizing wipes are provided in common areas, which making me feel very safe to use the facilities all the time.

The location of the apartment is super convenient with lots of great restaurants, groceries and pharmacy within walkable distance.  I would say it is the best value apartment you can get in West LA! I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to move to the westwide!","San Francisco, CA",0,2,1,0
2/16/2021,Garrett C.,-1,5.0,"The two and a half years I spent at 3700 Sepulveda was the best apartment experience I had while living in LA. While it is a somewhat older building, it has been updated very nicely, and the amenities are great! If I had planned on staying in LA, I probably would have stayed much longer! It was a pretty quiet community, never had any bug issues,  was maintained nicely, and despite the proximity to the 405, road noise was never an issue. If you're looking for a reasonably priced apartment with lots of amenities, 3700 is a great option!","Beaverton, OR",0,1,N/A,0

1/4/2021,Sam D.,-1,5.0,"I have lived in this building for the past 7 years and recently moved out. This is the longest I have stayed in any one building and in those 7 years the Management and Staff have always been great.  Goker, Humberto, Manny and Salvador have always been there and made my stay at the building feel like a Resort. I got the level of service I expected, if a problem arose it was fixed within a day or two. Also, the staff and management whom live there know you by name and wave a friendly Hi when passing you by which is a nice but rare commodity in LA. Overall, my time at the The Woodmere which is what it was called back then then before the name change to 3700 Sepulveda, was a very pleasant one.  No tenant horror stories from me, just a person sad to have to go but such is life. Overall, I am grateful for my time there, they made being a tenant too easy.. Everything always works or it gets fixed right away.","Culver City, CA",0,6,1,0
12/23/2020,Daliah E.,-1,5.0,"I lived there for 5 years and recently left for grad school. I enjoyed my time there greatly. The apartment complex is very well-mainted and maintenance needs are taken care of very fast.

The manager Goker and the staff have always been really friendly and caring. They are here to help 24/7 and I believe this was the biggest pro living at 3700 Sepulveda.

Gym and pool are always clean and well-maintained. Apartment building is extremely close to grocery stores like CVS, Trader Joe's, Ralphs etc. Moreover, the apartment building is in great location by being close to hot spots like Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney, Culver City, Westwood, Santa Monica and so on. I also find its location very practical for students at SMC and UCLA as a former student. Oh, also the airport! I think it is the great to be able to arrive LAX fast considering the LA traffic. The building also has closed parking lot that I treasure the most, and security is always around 24/7.

I recommend living at 3700 Sepulveda if you're looking for a family-friendly and peaceful place. This place helped me feel at home when I first came to LA, and I am sad for leaving. Hopefully, will be back soon!","Los Angeles, CA",0,3,N/A,0

They are in the process of updating apartment interiors which is a tedious task which can cause noise during the day, but all the property upgrades are worth it.

Amazing pool, great BBQ/pool area, outdoor rec area, awesome gym and business center. Of course covid has changed all of our lives and working from home with daytime construction noise is tough, but life goes on and at the end of the day this is a great place to live.","Los Angeles, CA",84,9,1,0

8/20/2020,Joseph G.,-1,5.0,My gf and I went all around WeHo and NoHo looking at places for later this year. We found  L and o after looking at the high rise building Noho14. We could have gotten a 10th floor apartment there for around $3400 but we didn't like the vibe of the people there. We don't want to compromise on service attitude anymore. We drove all the way from Covina and Denny helped us right away and even though it was already 5pm he took us for the tour. We were shocked at how sincere he was. We Forgot our masks and he had extra brand new ones to give us. Bonus: he gave us KitKat bars chips and sparkling water Lol! Denny took the time to show us a bunch of units and didn't mind my gf changing her mind a lot. He even had a tape measure handy. We're extremely into fitness and the biggest thing we can't wait for is their huge gym. It will be open 24hrs and even has Olympic bumper plates and deadlift rack. Insane.

Theres a Whole Foods opening downstairs and that was the main draw in for us besides hating our current management situation. Look all the buildings around here are essentially the same but for us after staying at noho lofts and going through management changes, were done compromising on bad attitudes and walking on eggshells. From the time we called until signing paperwork stan and the team members there have been insanely helpful and nice. Stan felt like an instant friend or even family. Their pool on the roof and huge gym center is super sick too. Were excited nd hope its not just smoke and mirrors with the customer service but from what we can tell, it feels like boutique customer service already and their concierge guy in a nice suit even personally walked us to the office because we were confused.

5/24/2020,Justin R.,-1,1.0,"Mack Property group is a disgrace to all business best practices. This group embodies the worst parts of capitalism.

We sent a request to Aven asking for rent compensation since our amenities have not been open for over two months. We received this response, which echoes the ethos of this company. I finally feel compelled to speak up.

As a business owner and customer, the letter attached is not just a little inappropriate but HIGHLY inappropriate to reference the financial balance sheet of Mack Property as an excuse to why they have poor customer experience and expect the residents of AVEN to subsidize their financial losses.

I do not care that Mack Property group is experiencing increased operating expenses and a loss of of revenue in the face of COVID-19. Mack Property group, like every other business, needs to access debt/equity markets to shore up their debt, ensure a quality product, and/or reimburse residents for their losses.

It is not my job as a consumer to absorb the risk of the capitalists (Mack Property mackredev.com and AECOM Capital aecom.com/aecom-capital) who took the risk to make an investment in Aven and other residential communities. I am not seeing any upside appreciation of my money (as many of us are currently experiencing) so I do not think that I, or anyone at AVEN, should be subsidizing the loses of this business or any business for that manner.

If Mack Property group wants to act as strong leaders they will be forthcoming in how they are going to alleviate these problems their consumers are experiencing. And pay us back.

I honestly would show more sympathy for this company if they were forthcoming, but they are not and business owners/investors like this need to be washed out so that we can have better owners/investors with better values, leadership, and financial discipline. If they can't make this right, then they should file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and take responsibility.

It is companies like this, that have driven a whole generation to hate businesses and free-enterprise. It is disgusting to watch and give my money to this organization.","Manhattan, NY",196,6,1,0
10/29/2019,Bree N.,-1,1.0,"Stars shouldn't be the only thing an incompetent apartment building can receive. How about the ""middle finger?"" I don't write reviews...period EVER because I find them to be a total waste of time. However, I had to announce the scum bag employee Merci Lim. She claims to be a Leasing Director I guess to appear relevant but when you call the owners in Boston, they say she's just a leasing consultant. Either way tomatoe/tomato...Merci called my cell with mis-information regarding an approval for me to move in. The conversation began with me requesting that my information be re-evaluated because the way the apartments approve and deny applicants is totally computer generated. Meaning it can be overridden by an actual human-being! Irregardless of property standards, their standards are too high for the poor quality of employees. Whether they say they can't or not, everything in life can be negotiated! Ask ANY entrepreneur or great business owner. I was approved with an additional deposit. Everyone who lives in the state of California knows it is very difficult to find a suitable place to lay your head. With crime at it's most high and the amount of money required to be safe is utterly ridiculous. Aven requires your first born child and a kidney just to rent a studio. I don't care how nice a building looks inside or outside nor do I give a rats ass about it's amenities, if I'm not going to own it later or if it doesn't pay me equity then its temporary BS. Now back to the original reason for this truthful post, Merci Lim is a demon from the pit of hell. No one should sign a 2,4,6,8,12,nor 24 month lease term on anything there with an individual like her on property. If it's hard to get approved it could be a sign that you're going to have a thorn in your ass, so I went with my gut and pulled my deposit. Not to mention all of the employees who live on-site as well just to get discounted rent. The units that they occupy could be rented to external residents that can pay more! So there you have it...more income out the door! Merci, flat out told me that ""I would be denied"" before she even collected all of the paperwork requested in order to move forward. She blatantly violated the ""Fair Housing Laws."" What kind of jack ass would do such a thing? Her job is to make sure that the apartment building is 100% leased! I was clearly a qualified candidate already with just a matter of bringing in paycheck stubs! Not deny future residents over the phone with your opinions without clear facts or documentation in front of you to make clear judgment! Merci needs to find another job. She's obviously NOT qualified to handle any situation in a professional and effective manner. If a tenant came in and reported this type of behavior to me, it would be grounds for termination of employment! I would not put up with that sh*t! Every person who has a title (i.e. director, manager, supervisor) don't always mean they're qualified or intelligent enough to handle the job given. I look at it like this, I always tell my money what to do, so if I am not treated with the respect that I am due, then you and your company can kiss my ass! No business from me, my friends, family, colleagues, acquaintances, etc. It only takes a minute to report bad businesses. I'm sure H.U.D. and the California Dept of Fair Housing would love to see another case on their desk in the morning. In addition to the BBB and any other web-based method to report a complete idiot. According to her LinkedIn profile she only stays in a leasing role for 1 year at most. Which speaks loudly to me as a Manager, she's a job hopper and she keeps a very un-attractive tenure with a lot of her previous companies. This clearly shows me as I thought from the very beginning...she's obviously NOT WORTH KEEPING! I will continue pursue further action against Merci Lim until the proper action is taken!

Thank you for reading and stay tuned...

P.S.) Instead of one star, I give this hell hole a two ""THUMBS DOWN!"" There are PLENTY of Tall buildings in DTLA, that makes this crap look like a one-story! Keep looking and don't waste your time.

7/2/2020,Yu Yan C.,-1,2.0,"So first we're promised credits for shutting down the amenities and now are given none as the management ""NEVER ANTICIPATED the length of these closures to span nearly three months""??? I am sooooo confused considering the amenities started to reopen on May 28 which aligns with when Aven DID ANTICIPATE reopening:

""Information regarding account credits for the reduction of amenity use will be assessed once these spaces are safe to re-open. At this time, we anticipate that being around mid-May.""

Given that some of the residents have lost their jobs, a small reimbursement is the least AVEN could do to support its community. Not to mention, the amenities is why the housing costs in this building are so high in the first place. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! Oh well...By saving on credits MACK properties will probably spend even more on getting people back.

If you still consider to invest in Aven, please know:

- Amenities are shared with a building next door (Grand Loft) which was never mentioned when signing the lease
- Cheep squeaky floors inside the units
- Dryer is a complete disaster, have to run 3 times for a single load
- Utility bills - water costs are split between all residents and the electricity meter has been broken for the past couple of months so when you're out of town, don't be surprised if the bill is still high","Los Angeles, CA",5,5,2,0
9/5/2019,Social M.,-1,2.0,"The building has so many amenities and is trying to offer all these perks but cant even manage to get additional Fobs/Keys for Residents. If you have maids or Dog sitters coming regularly you have to leave your own fob at the front desk and pick it back up. Which without a fob you cant even get into the building so you have to wait until somebody at concierge is at the front and wait until they are free to give you a key AND find parking in front of the building just to pick up your own house key and you cant even park your car in the Garage since you cant get into the Building trough the garage without keys.  Is it that hard to have a copy of your keys at concierge and an acknowledgement from the tenant to have set times when a spare key is needed like any other building?

8/11/2020,South Park R.,-1,4.0,"As someone who lived here for 16+ months, I thought I would provide an honest mention of issues that many reviews haven't touched on, especially the early 5-star reviews because keep in mind--AVEN will give back the cost of your application when you leave a review before signing, which is a bit unfair because of course people will say yes to that yet their review would only be based on the ""wow"" factor of seeing all the amenities and not on the actual living experience.

1. FIRE ALARM TESTING. We just got another email that prompted me to write this review. AVEN is a new building with vacant ground floor tenant spaces so what does that mean? Construction, fire inspections + ALARM TESTS. If you don't think it'll be that bad I've attached a pic of some emails we've received about testing, and that's not all of them. Though now we're in COVID times and lots are WFH, I can't imagine having gone to work this past year knowing my dog is home alone during all-day fire alarm testing. Not to mention staying at home with an infant or young child. Keep in mind that AVEN doesn't have control over how often the fire inspections/alarm tests will take place--that's up to how well the tenant does at clearing & passing all the fire code requirements, and that's not easy to do with a brand new restaurant space. AVEN themselves will admit that they can't really control it and can only hope the tenant does their best on the inspections. I imagine that more alarm testing will be going on in the next 4-6+ months, as they've just started construction.

2. GRILL AREAS SMELL LIKE DOG PEE IN THE HEAT. I have to start by saying that compared to other buildings in South Park , AVEN does the ABSOLUTE BEST JOB at washing away dog pee every day. Some buildings on Grand & Hill will make you want to barf just walking by, but AVEN's not like that at all. They hose down both the front entrance sidewalk & dog park every day. HOWEVER, whoever designed the amenity deck put the grills & tables literally right next to the ""dog park"" and dog walkway, which you can see on pictures shared. During the winters I didn't notice this as much but during the summer (which is grilling season!) it's bad. It smells like dog pee while you're grilling & eating. Any heat makes the smell especially unbearable and toward the end of the day is the worst, after a full day of 36 floors of dogs having peed in that area. I've seen residents cursing as they got up from the tables & left from the smell of dog pee.

3. UTILITY BILLS. AVEN has acknowledged and has written to us about our utility bills. Basically, utility bills are based on # of occupants & square footage than on meter reads. If you don't travel much, this might not be a problem but I've seen posts on our community board where residents will go out of town for 2-3 weeks out of a month and their utility bill comes out the same, and this is due to the way utility bills are calculated. I can also attest to this because we used to not run our dishwasher as much to save on water+electricity, but after finding out about this, we went from running it 1-2 times/month to 3-4 times/week and didn't see any increases in our bill. So if you're someone who travels often & doesn't want to pay for utilities you're not using, this is something to consider.

4. FLOOR BOARDS. The pictures of weird floor board placement in other reviews are true--we have 2 floor ""gaps"" in our own apartment. For us they're in our bedroom so guests can't see them, but they're really just a small annoyance where dust and other particles get stuck. More bothersome than the gaps are the floor boards themselves. I'm not sure how to describe them other than they feel like wood without a final coat on them. The floors are not easy to clean and get dirty extremely easily (something to consider if you have kids...or if you just spend a lot of time at home lol). I feel like they might just be of lesser quality in general because I would say after a few months of living here there are areas that ""creak"" when we walk on them now.

5. AMENITIES. If you're planning on moving during COVID, just keep in mind that most of the ""perks"" mentioned in other reviews don't currently apply. Resident events probably won't happen again for another 4-5 months or more, the gym is closed, you can't have family or guests in the amenities, and you have to wear masks when you're at the pool and basketball courts. Yes, there is a security member who will literally patrol the amenity deck every day & ask you to wear one even if you're standing by/sitting in the pool & not full-on ""swimming"" or are playing basketball. I get these are safety measures but just something to keep in mind.

AVEN is definitely a luxurious place to live, but these are a few points to consider before making an ultimate decision.","Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1,0

There is a team of security men, but they are not all nice! I have two dogs, so one downside is that there isn't any green space on the property for you to walk your pet or for your pet to play. The only other downside is that there isn't a pool. For the price of the place and especially it being new construction, I would think that they'd have a pool. I haven't had any issues since living here, and I feel that Shayne is very responsive and helpful. If you decide to move here, take advantage of the roof top deck (lovely views, BBQ pits, fire pits, TV's). I also love that there is a gym facility on site that it always very clean!

The amenities are great! It has a gym, 24-hour security, in unit washer/dryer, centralized air/heating system, and roof top with multiple BBQ and TVs. Unfortunately, no pool.

Beyond the amenities, I have to give it up to management! Shayne is the best! I've never had a better experience with management. He's always been accessible when needed and quick at responding to all of my request. He's proactive at sending email updates to keep us informed about anything going on with the building.

Luna Apartments is in a very great location in downtown Koreatown; there is amazing food and plazas all around, it's walking distance from a bunch of coffee shops, and it's very close The Wiltern. There's a gym, a community laundry area, and nice rooftop patio with seating areas where people can barbecue and relax. There's also an easily accessible online portal where rent can be paid and maintenance requests can be forwarded; since it was both of our first times living away from home, this made things less stressful for us. The Luna Management team, and the manager Shayne, are very promptly responsive to any questions or concerns. We had a few minor maintenance issues, like a clogged shower drain, and my requests were often fulfilled within 24 hours. I had unfortunately broken the folding pantry door, and though the process of replacing the door requires a lot of specific maneuvering and contracting, we were met with patience. It was difficult for us to maneuver was the dryer on the washer/dryer combination, but it is still convenient and time saving to have access to that in the apartment. Overall, we have noticed a lot of improvement in the building, and  management communication, since the early months of our lease. We've noticed, what seems to be, continuous efforts to adapt and ensure tenant comfort; and it has made us appreciate our experience living in Luna Apartments!","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

6/22/2019,Mike P.,-1,1.0,"Rent is high for what you get compared to the area. The promotion prices seem good, but they raise the prices on your when you renew and add additional charges as the years go on. They used to not charge for parking, but they now force you to pay for parking.

There are plenty of options at better value. K2 apartments and Radius next door are both nicer with better value. Wilshire/vermont apartments have direct access to the metro and have nicer apartment at better prices.

The Thompson not far away on Wilshire Blvd is a new building and have a ton of new units with better prices. A new apartment complex is being built across from Park Catalina at better prices.

When the office is closed, packages will be left outside of the office or in front of your door and they WILL get STOLEN. Kids from the school across come in the building to smoke weed and steal packages. They need a package locker like all of the modern apartment complexes these days.

You will be getting this a lot.
'Delivery attempted
An attempt was made to deliver your package, but the business was closed. Please look for a notice of attempted delivery for the next steps.'

This happens very often.
They just leave a note saying ""we are open 11am to 1pm"" even though regular office hour is 9am to 6pm and shut the door.

This will be very frustrating.
I would not moved in if I knew this so please save yourself.

During that tour, we meet the staff at Park Catalina Apartments and were so impressed with their facility, positive attitude, willingness to accommodate our limited schedule that we decided that this was the place for them.  The apartment they showed us had been recently renovated with all new floors, countertops and appliances.  Since we initiated the process, every member of their staff: Jazmin Pegeron, Dave Giguere & Pierre Brougeille, have gone above and beyond what was expected to meet what ended up being a very challenging window to obtain due to classes for one of the boys starting within 30 days of the date we were ready to make a commitment.  Initially, the boys would have arrived with the U-Haul 3 days prior to the move-in date.  Jazmin had a matching newly renovated apartment on the same floor give notice a few days before the boys left for LA, allowing them to move in when they arrived.  Service at this level in the apartment business is rare.

10/25/2021,Mike P.,-1,1.0,"It's a sinking ship here.

- Everyone worth the fees we pay that used to work here has either left or been let go of- minus 1or 2. One after another. Building's only been open about 3 years. Unbelievable turnover.
- Our main (and only) gate wasn't working for the better part of 2 months. Lots of ""fluff"" about it, but what can you really believe these days? Finally up and running. And ok, we had a ""guard"" brought in that wasn't always there...
-Practically all the main people living here have or are leaving. Sure, maybe some are for betterment, but when you see people you know picking up and moving out, one after the other over several months, it makes you wonder and it starts to add up.
- SMOKE-FREE building- NOT SO MUCH! Elevator- smells like pot. Hallway- (I know not just mine) smells like pot. Unit- smells like pot with door/window shut. Balcony- smells like pot.
- Dog piss - literal cascade of piss- constantly raining down on your balcony if you're lucky enough to have a dog anywhere above you. Feel sorry for those living several levels below me!
- Balconies have no lights and you're not allowed to have lights unless it's building approved, which they won't approve! For half a year we've been told they will purchase lights for us, so far nothing. Put my request in long ago. Probably lost with all the ship jumpers. I swear it's like a dorm here. Can't do anything without a letter being put out about it.
- Communal Spaces- yes. Want to reserve a spot for a small get-together? Yes- but only if you pay an exorbitant usage fee! And if there's buyout for filming or something, you're assed out. Nothing comes to you for the inconvenience of not being able to access what you're supposed to be able to access via the fees you pay for rent. It's Hollywood. Filming doesn't happen for free peeps.
- The hall to the gym is affectionately known to some here now as the Hall of Snortsville. It sounds like there's a cocaine fest happening.. You can't walk to the gym or library without hearing so much snorting coming out of the main office. It's ridiculous!

Can I go on? Yep. I will close by saying do your research before you choose this place. I get it, this is a one of a kind building. That's why I'm still here. I don't know for how much longer as you can tell. Addiction is in many forms.
If none of what I wrote affects you, you have nothing to worry about. But if you value your freedom and don't want to live somewhere that's nothing more than a money making opportunity for the owners, look around. There is better value for your dollar- no matter the dollar you make.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

The leasing office is chalk full of professional and knowledgeable personnel who always greet you with a smile. 24/7 concierge team that goes above and beyond for your needs, even in our COVID driven limitations. It doesn't get any better than Bryan and Geoff! The current maintenance team is incredible and invests the time and resources needed for creative solutions to repetitive issues. I had a balcony door that constantly blew open during high winds, often breaking the hardware that's supposed to keep it from doing just that. Renzo, the building manager, came up with some kind of bar replacement (not Mickey Moused) that eliminated the issue entirely. Thanks Renzo! The cleaning crew (big props to Abraham...my Laker man!) is non-stop, including night crew several nights a week. Always insuring the upkeep and appearance of the building is level 1- especially difficult on weekend nights- but they get it done. It is with heartfelt sadness that I've had to relocate.

internet, water, power, garbage, fitness center, Hello Alfred grocery shopping service, light cleaning, 24 hour coffee service, towel service and parking are ALL included and they run different offers for referrals for new residents etc. The security is amazing and super on top of it and they always offer my guests a bottle of water while they ring my apartment for arrivals, they know the residents by name, it almost feels like living at a Ritz Carlton. The green spaces are beautiful and well maintained, as well as all of the common areas are cleaned every single day at 6am. I am up early every morning and the entire building is immaculate by 8am. The aesthetics are beautiful and you know when you find Jo Malone diffusers in the lobby bathrooms that you are in a special place. Terra is the full time concierge and is amazing and super friendly. Jesus manages the common areas including the 3 grills outside and dog walk and pool including towel service, the billiard area and library with fireplace and is super consistent with cleaning and maintaining the property.

Included within the rent is the concierge service Hello Alfred tidying my apt while I'm at work, and also doing my grocery shopping/errands...which is a so nice when you have a demanding schedule. They even leave nice hand-written cards after cleaning the apartment!

The common areas are well kept, and not to mention very well decorated, especially the game room with the fun pool table and TVs. The outdoor pool on the 5th floor has amazing views of Hollywood (facing the iconic Capitol Records building), and is always immaculate. It can be difficult to find new buildings that are dog friendly these days, and I love that Argyle House even built a cute dog run for dogs in the building to play in.

So many things to do around here. Saw their one bedroom apartments. Nice size and interior was pretty updated. Washer and dryer in unit!! A must these days. Garage parking also a must. The staff here was very patient and answered all my questions.

Parking in this area is plentiful. You can park on both sides. There's meter parking closer to the business building on Wilshire.  Lots of dogs in this area so would be a perfect place for my little terrier to make friends.","Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",15,26,5,0

As it is such a new building I thought it might be possible that there would be one. I have been on this search for a few months.
I received a message & a call back from Ryan, Community Manager. Ryan answered all my questions and more. He was so helpful and I appreciated his kindness and the time he took - I haven't had such a pleasant experience during my entire time searching. I would love to live in a building with such a considerate & thoughtful Community Manager!","Los Angeles, CA",0,3,N/A,0

Ryan is extremely knowledgeable and really pleasant to work with. He could tell me everything to do in the area from the Hollywood Sign hike, to all of the ""go to"" restaurants and hot spots! After shopping around you cannot beat the price and location. Right on the sunset strip a couple blocks from all of the touristy attractions on Hollywood Blvd.

I took a look at a studio and 1 bedroom. The apartments are brand new-nice knowing the appliances are brand new too! These are luxury apartments that come with quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances and even keyless entry into your home (like entering in your code on your cell phone!).

The amenities are not open yet, but expected to in May as long as there are no delays with the construction. There will be a sky deck on the top floor facing the Hollywood sign(awesome for small get together), a clubhouse, pool, spa and 2 story fitness center. There's some type of pet washing station and pet park, but I didn't really pay attention since I don't have a pup.

5/18/2020,Chanel E.,-1,1.0,"If you like being treated with respect, don't live here. I was a resident here for two years. There are so many bad stories I can share about this place, from the condescending staff to the non-stop false fire alarms in the middle of the night, that I would literally be wasting my life trying to explain them. Don't let the fancy building and 'public listed company' slogan fool you. They just care about making money. But in case you are not convinced, I will give you an example of how badly you can expect to be treated. FIRST - When I enquired on my appt, the price was $2400. 2 days later the price was $2700 and they wouldn't honour the original price I was given. SECOND - When I told them I wanted to break my lease and move out, they told me they could put me on Rent Responsible which means they will advertise my apartment and I can stop paying rent as soon as someone else leases my apartment. THEY DIDN'T ADVERTISE MY APARTMENT UNTIL 2 MONTHS LATER, when I threw a stink about it. And made up a STUPID excuse as to why it wasn't advertised. THIRD - I have since moved out, and it's been 34 days and I still have not received my deposit (because the first time they sent it to me a week ago, they wrongly put some other randoms name on the check so I couldn't deposit it). Most of the people who work here are incompetent so don't get your hopes up.

In in case corporate want to know how ALL the residents (Yes, we have a group chat) feel about your staff, here is quick summary:

Jordan (leasing manager) - He's nice enough, but hasn't really learnt that his job comes with responsibilities yet so don't take his title seriously.
Analicia (ass. manager) - Absolutely the most incompetent person working in the building, she has NO idea wtf she's talking about and has to 'check with the manager' about everything which makes her job pretty redundant.
Courtney (leasing) - Should not be in customer services because she talks to people like she owns the Earth and we are all getting in the way of her date with herself.
Jackie (leasing) - She's a gem. She is the only thing this place has going for it.
David (leasing) - Harmless but hasn't read the user manual for his job - so don't believe anything he says.

Basically, do yourself a favour and stay away from this place.","San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

10/10/2018,Maxwell J.,-1,1.0,"Really nice communal spaces and amenities, and the units themselves are well done. However, you're buying into management and community, not just nice finishings - both of which are terrible here. The fire alarms go off at least once a week after midnight and management has done nothing about it. The hallways aren't kept the cleanest, the rent is exorbitant for the building to not have a gym (the discount at EQX is nice but not THAT nice), and everyone seems to have a problem getting their deposits back when they leave.

Until they fix the management disconnect, it's not worth it to pay this much to not be able to sleep.","Los Angeles, CA",244,3,N/A,0
1/29/2017,Ian H.,-1,1.0,"I can't tell you how many times the fire alarms have gone off here since I moved in and I have only lived here for less than 2 months.

I have been woken up between 3am-6am more times than I can count on both hands. I have trouble sleeping and can't get back to sleep after they go off and they go off for minimum 10 minutes. I cant sleep afterwards so by the time I have to leave for my work at 9am I am so tired and my entire day is affected. I hear from other frustrated occupants of the camden that they experience fire alarms nearly everyday during the sunlight hours as well as the early morning however I am normally not home in the daytime to experience this.

Then when you talk to management they do nothing other than say they are working on resolving this. They do not care. They just want your money then once you move in they just do not care.

I am so unhappy living here and am looking to breaking my lease early.

I live on the 4th floor so every time the elevators are out which is very often I have to walk down then back up 4 flights of stairs. Imagine carrying 4 bags of groceries up 4 or more flights of stairs almost every week, it's horrendous and the staff or manager have not once offered help or offered to make a deduction from rent for the inconveniences.

9/12/2016,Jake P.,-1,1.0,"If you're looking for the most Ghetto apartment complex in Hollywood- look no further than The Camden.  We listen to constant altercations between our neighbors, loud music blasting from the sketchy folks hanging in the pool and the constant loud fire alarms going on daily/night monthly.
And now we have RATS IN THE TRASH AND NO WATER AT ALL FOR AN ENTIRE 48 hours so far.
Management is doing absolutely nothing for their residents. Be cautious of the community manager, he is literally unable to make decisions and fails to respond to emails on a regular basis.
You would think in this day and age that a tenant wouldn't have to listen to the elephant living above. The ceilings/floor are paper thin. Shame the construction is so cheap for ""luxury living"".
Leasing agent/sales were caught in too many lies.

Pool is nice but lately is a frat party on the weekends.  
Maintenance is nonexistent or clueless. They are not qualified in any aspect of handyman workmanship.
The Camden is a hostile living environment that I strongly suggest you avoid.","Los Angeles, CA",3,3,N/A,0
9/12/2016,Hayel R.,-1,1.0,"I would advise people to look elsewhere. The staff is incredibly rude in the office, including the manager. The office hours are ridiculous if you work in an office job. There is no security and or maintenance. There are several issues within the building that are overlooked by incompetent employees.

I feel like I'm living in the ghetto. It doesn't look like the ghetto - but beware - it operates as such.
.
Another neighbor three doors down had a wild party - bongs and all - 3am it was still raging. Guess who had to ask them to quiet it down? NOT SECURITY.

The evacuation/smoke alarms go off ALL the time at insane times - middle of the night/early mornings.

The building has been falling apart and not repaired since no one has a clue of what needs to be done.
Final straw was that there is no hot water or cold water as of Monday September 12 and who knows when the water will return.  No alert was sent to the residents about the situation, email or nothing until later that night. That email only stated that there was something wrong and that more details will follow as they become available.

The incessant barking dogs do not help either.

9/12/2016,E M.,-1,1.0,"The Leasing agents are totally unprofessional & inept for problems concerning tenant units on repairs such as pipes, and appliances. The building as of right now doesn't have any water either hot or cold going now for 24 hrs.
The people who work in the office are rude and argumentative. The fire alarm goes off in the middle of the night sometimes 3-4 times in one night. The hallways smell like urine or most of the time POT. The pool is always dirty. Everyone who works in the office tells you a different thing if you have any questions, no one is on the same page. DO NOT make the mistake of moving in here unless you like feeling disrespected and treated like shit, especially for the price you are paying which is much higher than nicer apartments in the same area.
Moved in July in and I'm already regretting it big time. Everything here is falling apart and the management really doesn't seem to care whatsoever. Very rude management. I live here & and literally nothing works from the Air conditioning, the trash compactor, to a simple act of being able to take a shower since they cut the water now for 24 hrs and going just for the fun of it. No one has a single clue how to run this place, hiring again nothing but incompetent, non- qualified people that doesn't have a single clue on what to do.
The staff is more interested in having FREE pool parties so every hobo from W Hollywood can stop by and have free wine tasting and free pool usage.
The management staff are fake smiles and promises.
Also, the elevator has been broken on and off now, and you can't enter the residences from the stairs, so enjoy your morning commute!  
The security is nothing but a ridiculous joke. They SIT DOWN in their PHONE ALL DAY LONG.  They are completely USELESS and utterly ignorant.
I could go on and on about this place but what's the point since they will probably delete this review and replace it with a fake one anyhow.  IF YOU ARE ABLE TO READ THIS, AVOID THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX!!!!!!!!!

I WOULD GIVE THIS PLACE NO STARS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!!!","Los Angeles, CA",15,12,N/A,0
7/7/2017,Damien B.,-1,4.0,"Overall this is a great complex with all the luxury amenities, including a saltwater pool and spa, screening room, outdoor cooking areas and 24-hour front desk service.  The area is growing rapidly with a Trader Joes conveniently located across the street and a Whole Foods planned for the near future up the block, as well as new eateries and entertainment venues opening all the time.  

There are a couple of things where the property falls short for which I am holding back that 5th star.  First, they built the main lobby with only one elevator.  A single elevator to service 10 floors.  Needless to say, tenants spend sometimes 5 minutes or more waiting on an elevator to arrive.  There are 3 other elevators in opposite corners of the building, but more consideration should have been put into the main lobby, especially when the other elevators seem to go out-of-service regularly.  Second, they did not install sinks in the main outdoor kitchen, so we are preparing food and handling raw meat and there is nowhere nearby to wash our hands or cooking utensils.  Third, and this is just based on my preferred design esthetic, they have a multitude of Camden branded rain mats covering the beautifully designed poured concrete flooring in the lobby.  They are ugly and dingy and should only be put out as a safety measure when it's wet outside, alas I have mentioned this to management and nobody has acknowledged it.   Lastly, there is a lot of new construction going on in the immediate area, which starts at 7am, so many of the units experience noisy conditions as a result.  This is not going to stop any time soon.","Los Angeles, CA",1020,2,N/A,0

Pros:
-The management and leasing team. They deliver a top-quality service here.
They will assist you anytime and are working every day to improve and keep the standing.
That is really important to feel supported where you live, right? And always with the smile: Class!
Jordan, Analicia, Jacqueline, Devon...we're so lucky to have such a team here!
-The units are spacious and gorgeous.
Yes, the kitchen is a real gourmet kitchen with a ton of storage.
They don't pretend to be ""luxurious"": it is luxurious.
-Super clean, modern, well maintained.
I've lived here since 2018, it's a sincere review.
-The building is from 2016. They've already improved and fixed issues noted from the previous years like every new construction might encounter.
-The maintenance team is very prompt and professional.
- 24/7 concierge for you, your guests and packages. Security guards.
-Assigned parking if needed, spacious and safe.
-Location, everything you need is at a walkable distance!
Cons:
-Yes, we had fire alarms, usually on weekends, and caused by people smoking in a non-smoking community, but they are fixing the problem with cameras and eventually evictions.

Most importantly I definitely saw that passion how he presented every area of the building. He was very knowledgeable and very informative. The Camden is really lucky to have an employee like Enrique. Honestly I had to test Enrique with a friend of mine and I wanted to see if he was honestly his personality how he resented him self. Or was he just putting a sales tactic. And come to find out that he treated my friend with the same treatment he gave me. I can't wait to move to the camden and I definitely will be sending all my friends and acquaintances to Enrique because he is truly a delight and what I call true definition of real Customer service.

Cat was kind enough to reach out to us the following morning to let us know that someone else expressed interest in the same apartment. Had she not done that, we would've missed out. I love our apartment! It is in great condition, clean, with brand new appliances.

It definitely makes the craziness of living in downtown Hollywood seem like you still have your own home oasis you can retreat to after coming home from work or whatever.

Enrique was the name of the agent who gave me a tour, then helped me get into my new place. He is amazing! Such a kind, positive person who has gone above & beyond to help me feel like I'm home here at Camden. He even helped me get set up with someone down at Equinox & a few other things that really displayed he loves what he does here. Would definitely recommend that you take a tour with him when you come in!

Diana was the one other person who helped me with moving in, she was wonderful as well. Along with all the staff in the leasing office & security downstairs.

Such a surprisingly, incredible experience since I have been here in Camden. Lived at 1600 Vine across the street before this for a bit, along with living in many other high rises/mid rises. Highly recommend giving Camden a look next time you go apartment shopping! :)","San Jose, CA",952,2,N/A,0
6/7/2019,C R.,-1,5.0,"We have just moved into The Camden and couldn't be happier. I've had my eye on this community since moving back to California a few years ago and am so happy to finally be here. This is the 3rd Camden property that my family has lived in and I can honestly tell you that by far this one has everything. It's situated near everything you need from Trader Joes being across the street to Bed Bath and Beyond being on the opposite corner. You really can park your car and just walk. I love how the community has tons and tons of features from a real screening room to really nice and clean cooking stations outside if you want to bake a pizza in the pizza oven or use one of the outdoor grills all complete with flat screen tvs for entertaining. Enrique was our leasing host and did a phenomenal job taking us around throughout the property and welcoming us into our home. He answered every question and also took us on a tour of a few additional apartments since we know that we'll be renting a second home here soon in addition to our first one. If you are in the entertainment space, film, editing, music, art, or just need to be near any of the studios for any reason this is definitely your place. There is even a WeWork right across the street however the way the Camden is setup your onsite community and common areas are just as nice if not even more private. We are definitely going to be very happy here!","Long Beach, CA",0,2,N/A,0

It fits my lifestyle perfectly.  The amenities are top notch...from the salt water pool, the theatre, the hub and all of the creative spaces throughout the building...and let me not forget the most convenient way to keep my fit lifestyle with Equinox...which feels like my very own private gym.  

Above all, what makes it feel like home and an ongoing amazing experience are the talented and super helpful staff - Sascha, Brandon, Collette, and Brittany.  Sascha you have a special place on my angels list for all of the runaround and paperwork you've helped me with.  Thank you!

4/11/2018,Sebastian S.,-1,5.0,"My husband and I moved into the Camden in May of 2016, shortly after its completion. While at the time this was intended as a temporary housing solution in the interim of selling our condo in West Hollywood and buying a new one, the Camden very quickly became our home. Over the nearly 2 years that we have lived here, we have been spoiled to the point that we find it very hard to imagine living anywhere else. From the contemporary style and finishes to the myriad of amenities (salt water pool, hot tub, cabanas, movie theater, club house/kitchen, recording studio, dog park with washing/drying stations, patios with pizza oven/BBQs, etc.), anyone will  be hard pressed to find an apartment building of equal standing in the area. Moreover, the presence of a world class gym such as Equinox -- accessible from the building lobby -- makes it very easy to never want to leave the haven of comfort that the Camden boasts right in the midst of the hustle and bustle of central Hollywood. Last but not least, the friendly and helpful staff round out the experience.  The maintenance team is highly skilled and most of them have been with the building from the get-go, so they are rather familiar with the fittings and equipment (Bruno especially is a gift from heaven). The leasing staff is incredibly friendly and helpful -- with the long-standing concierge, Cassandra, being a major asset to the building. The online building portal makes maintenance requests a breeze and also allows you to conveniently make rent payments and reserve building amenities. Moreover, it informs about any upcoming community events -- of which there are plenty --, usually with delicious catered food/drink from local restaurants and wellness treatments offered by the Equinox spa and several other providers. These events are not only reserved to residents but also to their pets, making the Camden an ideal place to be a pet owner. The aforementioned dog park and the washing/drying stations allow you to cater to your dog/cat without leaving the building -- even though it is a pleasure to walk the neighborhood and enjoy just how very far it has come in the last few years. Just steps from the building lobby you will find a fantastic Trader Joe's and enough restaurants (both casual and fine dining), hair/nail salons, bars/nightclubs, fitness facilities (such as Barry's), the Arclight Cinemas and several trendy hotels such as the W, the Redbury and the Kimpton Everly to satisfy your every craving. The building also happens to have arrangements in place with several of these establishments for special pricing/treatment for Camden residents. While I could go on and on about why we feel so very at home at the Camden, I recommend you book a tour and see for yourself!

8/20/2017,Dominick H.,-1,5.0,"I want to first say THANK YOU TO THE CAMDEN HOLLYWOOD. I started my APT journey awhile back with The Camden and to be honest it has been a great experience. Anytime I've a problem it doesn't matter who I talk to I get the same experience. Living in a building with people I can trust on the management side is amazing.

My experience first start with my friends at the Front Desk lobby always being so welcoming when I come into the building.

Josh and Peter thank you for being such an amazing leader and creating the best culture for you team to be able to deliver and be gracious.

Cassandra, you're more than amazing party curator and leasing agent that's be honest, you give the best design advice for a space. When I was doubting my unit you sent me over some of the cutest options to decorate an I will never forget when you came in my unit to measure that Kitchen Island (Who knew she was good with dimension.)

Brandon, always has a smile on his face and the best aroma of energy, like he knows everyone name ""its crazy"". When I go in the office there never a dog that Brandon doesn't great him.

Amanda, that me first of by saying this girl has a wealth of knowledge. Anytime I've a question about my unit or a bill. She always knows the right answer. I love coming in the office to talk with her she's personable and easy to talk with. ""Even when its my fault"".

Sasha, well thank you so much. I recently transferred into another unit and Sasha has always kept me updated on the new leasing rates. She probably showed me almost 10 different units over the last 2 1/2 months. Every Saturday and Sunday it's pool day for me and my friend, Sasha always comes and says hi. My guest always ask, ""Where's Sasha she's the best"" I always have to reply back, ""Working, now have fun"".

These agents make me fell like the leasing office, to the lobby , hell even the hallways is my home.Thank you Cassandra for yesterday and Sasha helping me close the deal. I was considering leaving The Camden(not for a bad reason), But then I realize where I am I going get this type of service, I'll wait............ I am not, I feel like it's personalize service only for me, but then i watch the room and I see everyone get's this level of service.

Well Thank You to another 12 months ,  ""Know know where I'm at, you know where I be""

love always

Residents are very friendly, respectful of each other, and mingle frequently. Management is very responsive, helpful, and pleasant in every way.

11/3/2021,Anna B.,-1,5.0,"If you are on the hunt for your next apartment in LA, Jardine is it. I have been apartment hunting for over a year in LA and as soon as I saw Jardine - knew it was the place for me. Every experience you have as soon as you step foot inside: the incredible concierge service, 24/7 valet, gorgeous lobby, apartment layouts, state-of-the-art gym, heated pool & more feels like an A-list experience.

In addition to the outstanding amenities, a huge thing that sold me on Jardine was the community. The concierge staff Markwell, Louise, Juan and Precious bring me legitimate joy. They are the BEST and go above and beyond to help you with anything you need. My move-in process with Markwell was seamless. In addition to the staff, the residents are all so friendly - I've met someone new everyday since living here. Coming out of COVID, finding a sense of community was a big thing I wanted in my next apartment and I'm so happy I found Jardine.

I toured a lot of luxury apartments in Los Angeles before deciding on Jardine and found that most felt really sterile and/or had nice amenities but average apartment layouts. There isn't a single element of my apartment OR the building that I'm not completely obsessed with.

7/2/2021,Grace J.,-1,1.0,"This is a terrible apartment. I want to move out right now. I started complaining about the smell in the guest bathroom from February and have complained several times. I moved in last Febrary and the smell problem has started since then.They come over to check it out and that's it. It still smells but the maintenance status changes to Done as soon as they returen and they never asked me again if I was ok or if the problem was over. Since then, my husband has complained that the bathroom in the room he was using as his study room still smelled, so I had to block the vents in the guest bathroom and felt the smell was better than before. But after the shower, the fan could not be turned on. After that, the smell problem has now moved to the living room.

A few days ago, the vent in the livingroom started smelling like food waste. I requested maintenance again for both the guest bathroom and living room. One of the maintenance guys came in today with a filter sheet to cover it over the vent in the ceiling of the guest bathroom. However, the smell in the Guest bathroom is coming again and living room smell is getting worst at night due to the high temperature. It's been happening since February and my husband and I have been having a bad experience at The Pearl for almost 5 months. I have an air purifier in my living room, but it doesn't remove the smell because the vents are right above me. I don't think they can fix this issues and I feel they already know this. This is a garbage apartment.

The apartment is built with cheap materials. They advertise this as a luxury apartment, but all appliances and materials are below average. A lot of people say that not many people renew their contracts and I agree with that and I understand why they want to move out of this apartment. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone around.","SoMa, San Francisco, CA",0,1,N/A,0

Updated review",M.M L.,-1,1.0,"I love how my review is ""not recommend"" by yelp now. Even though 5 people have found it useful. It's funny because there are so many 5 star reviews of people that don't even live here just came for a tour but yelp doesn't not recommend those. It just goes to show yelp is ""pay to play"". but for those who actually live here/interested in living here- Update: the pearl claims to ""care for its residents during this time"" and ""wants to minimize contact as much as possible"" - If they wanted to ""minimize contact"" & thats why we have to have parcel pending. WHY haven't we halted the trash pick up? RIGHT- b/c thats mandatory $30 a month. How is everyones trash in the hallway minimizing contact? its so disgusting and horrendous what i have to smell on my way to my apartment and to have to pay for it? so upsetting. This past month I paid $45 for trash ALONE. Additionally, this building has done nothing to help with the current pandemic, not even an email regarding if you can't pay your rent or a discount for not having any amenities. I'm sure they will comment on this review saying that on the lease it says they can stop amenities at any time. So stop the trash pick up. It's useless and a waste of money. RESIDENTS DO NOT WANT TRASH PICK UP. how many times are we going to have to say it for you to care? Stop the BS of ""caring for our residents during this time"" and show us with actions. I.e discounts for no amenities, taking our packages w/o parcel pending, an option for ppl who can't pay rent, removing trash pick up etc.. that is how you show you care for residents during this time not empty words.

Also- If you are lucky enough to be reading this on the pearls main page with all the reviews, I highly recommend going to the ""not recommended"" section which is all the way at the bottom of the page in small letters.

7/20/2021,J L.,-1,1.0,"Where do I even begin... I'm not one to write a bad review EVER, but my experience here was so negative that I really feel I need to warn anyone that might be moving in here expecting a ""luxury"" experience.

I was a tenant here for 2 years, and to say this place is ""luxury"" is a joke. While the spaces seem nice and some units even have great views, the management is the absolute worst I have ever encountered.

The building is located in Hollywood, so it's a given that some unsavory things can happen in the area, but the building's poor response to all of these things was beyond a disappointment. For one, we had a gun shooting right outside our door, and the management tried to cover it up, pretend like it didn't happen and make excuses for why they had to close down the entire building, saying it was due to an ""incident in the area"" -- in the area? Then why are there gunshot marks literally right outside my door? Why are there news reporters surrounding our entire building?  Instead of making us feel safe and putting our minds at ease that they are doing everything in their power to ensure the safety of their residents, when the building manager was confronted about the situation, she just shrugged and said ""it wasn't our fault, it could happen anywhere."" Wow, way to make us feel safe sleeping here at night!

We also had personal belongings chained to our parking spot in the garage stolen while we were out of town, and when we asked for video footage to share with the police for the police report, the cameras had somehow mysteriously JUST crashed, and they only had footage from the last few days. Hmmm... isn't that a strange coincidence?

To top off our bad experience, when we finally moved out - I received a huge bill for re-painting the walls and carpet cleaning. We left the place super clean, and if this is such a luxury building - isn't it a given that the building re-paints the walls in between every tenant? Obviously after 2 years of living in a place, there may be minor scuffs on the walls, and I have never in my life been charged for normal wear and tear that comes with living in a place for years. When I tried to inquire about why I was being charged, I got no reply, and literally 2 weeks later, the balance was sent to collections. WTF?? You ignore my inquiry and then try to mess with my credit score? What luxury treatment indeed.

THE INSIDE - this 2 story highrise and the floor to ceiling windows are its main attractions since natural light floods every room but more importantly being the top corner opens up to the most unbelievable breathtaking views right from your living space and bedroom.

The building has not opened yet, and has not allowed anyone to visit - if people are claiming they are excited to be at certain amenities, or whatever else, they are lying. The building is creating fake reviews to counter any negative publicity right now.

More importantly, like the other actual reviews, this building's management has been completely unprofessional and unresponsive. I was set to move into the building at the beginning of September, and then told with little warning that this would no longer be possible because the building had failed an inspection. Staff refused to give a timeline on when they would be set to
actually let people tour, let alone move in. Have tried calling back since - almost every time I have been sent to voicemail. We relied on moving in at the beginning of the month, and have been forced to look elsewhere, and the management seems completely unconcerned with getting the building ready for move in. They are still advertising leasing options and move in dates as if they are ready, which is completely unprofessional and effectively false advertising.

After touring with Kristin at Trademark in DTLA I felt so compelled to tell everyone how amazing she is! Kristin is so knowledgeable about the building and surrounding area, she made me feel comfortable and took time to answer all of my questions. We are moving from the Bay Area and have been inundated with apartment tours and other leasing agents that did not make us feel welcome. I would recommend my friends and family.. honestly anyone and everyone to request a tour with Kristin she's the best.

I have been living here almost a year and would not change a thing. I love the staff (shout out to Eddy, Shaun, Robin, Daniel, Larry, and Priscilla)--but a particular shout out to Kristin, who on day one sent me a virtual tour of multiple floor spaces while the building was under construction, and who today, almost a year later, still is sincerely invested in ensuring I am comfortable.

1/22/2020,Miguel A.,-1,5.0,"I met with James for a tour of the property and by the end of it, I was sure that I wanted to move to the Trademark. James was very professional and took his time to give me a tour of the building and all of the beautiful amenities. The building itself is brand new and gorgeous! The Trademark checks all the boxes for me and even exceeded my expectations.

The Trademark has all the best in amenities and comfort that you could hope for. A beautiful mailroom with a Parcel locker system for receiving packages, and even includes refrigerated units for fresh food delivery. The clubhouse is amazing and very well decorated and even includes a pool table. That leads out to the pool area that is spectacular to say the least. It all looks more like a 5 star resort than an apartment building in the middle of DTLA. The gym has all the latest workout equipment and Trademark even offers a towel service. Pictures don't really do the pool area justice, you have to see it to really appreciate it. The rooftop deck is really amazing too with plenty of space to lounge, great views, outdoor televisons and it even has a dog area to walk your dog!

James was very patient with all my questions and had an answer for every one. He showed me two different apartments/floor plans, each with it's own unique layout. He then gave me a tour of the model which really helped to envision the space furnished. At no point did my tour feel rushed and James really took the time to help me decide which apartment would be best for me.

I have looked at other apartment buildings in the DTLA area and honestly for what you get at the Trademark, the lease prices are incrediblly reasonable and I didn't find any other building that even came close, which is why I submitted an application for my apartment on the spot.

Since my tour, Kristen has been very helpful as well with my application, and I get a sense that the entire staff is very committed to proving excellent service and really, what more could you ask for?

I'm very excited to move in and to be able to call the Trademark, my new home!","Los Angeles, CA",5,7,18,0

To top it off there was this nice rooftop lounge right next to the pool with a gorgeous view of the Hollywood sign (made for some stunning pictures).

4/12/2019,Veronica U.,-1,1.0,"I wish I can give ZERO STARS.
I cannot say enough: DO NOT MOVE TO THAT APARTMENT NIGHTMARE!
I moved out about 9 months ago and I am still experiencing PTSD.
It IS true that Josie starts off as your friend but that only lasts as long as she is done using you for a car ride to the market every now and then.
Let me start here:
The apartments at Apartment Nightmare (I choose to call it that for reasons stated below) are sold based on these amenities:
1. Apartments all have washer/dryer. Not true. SOME have them do and if your apartment doesn't have one you are stuck with washer/dryers that break down a lot. And. You lose your money if it gets stuck in there. No apologies.
2. They sell you the idea of a pool and gym.
The pool is cleaned sparingly so tread carefully when entering it.
The chairs are ragged and sometimes, tenants allow their dogs to sit or lay on them. Ew.
3.  The gym is a JOKE. The machines are all dated with a few of them so old that they don't work anymore. If she tries to sell you on that gym, HAVE HER OPEN THE DOOR AND EXAMINE THE MACHINES IN THAT JOKE OF A ""GYM"". You will find that I am not lying. The gym smells like feet after a LONNNNNG day at work, while wearing sweaty sneakers with no socks and running in the rain. Ew.
4. The television doesn't work.
The monitor, she told me, doesn't work. Since the only way to access the gym is through the door leading to the pool, you can find yourself in a scary situation if someone decides to jump over the fence or is let in by friendly tenants. So, with monitors that don't work, you are in deep S**T. I lived alone and worked until 7 pm and the only time I could work out was between 7:30 pm and 8 pm to 9 pm. I always felt scared. I mean, DANGEROUS MUCH???
5. Sometimes the hallway lights go out and it will take days to fix. You will have to beg for things to get fixed over there.
Some of the apartments have issues when it rains. Like wall damage and you need to wear boots damage. I know of a few tenants who had these issues and I truly felt sorry for them. I don't know the extent of the water damage was enough for people to move out. I was one of them. No apologies, no reimbursement of damages, nothing. I should have sued them but I just wanted to get out of there.
6. Go check out the bike stand by the entrance to the lobby if you plan to move there. Some of them have been there so long, the wheels are deflated and they are all dusty.
7. Lastly, everyone gets the same keypad number to enter when I was there. A few tenants that I am still in contact tell me that it hasn't changed. So when someone moves out, if they had a grudge, they can easily give out that number. THIS IS NOT SAFE.

Just listen to me: GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT YOU LOVE. For the money that people pay there (and only because they are being sold on the idea of a pool and a ""state-of-the-art"" gym), it really isn't worth it.

Not. One. Bit.

And, if they delete this account and put up another one, I have already copied this review. I WILL repost. I feel that it is my DUTY to warn people ...","Burbank, CA",0,1,N/A,0

10/9/2017,Sean J.,-1,5.0,"I recently moved to California and in the process of looking for a place to live, I came across Josie Evans, Resident Manager at Valley Apartments. Up to this point, my experience looking for a place to say had been dreadful to say the least. About half of properties that I came across didn't have Leasing Offices so I was forced to either call and leave a message or send an e-mail in the hopes that someone would get back to me. Needless to say, most didn't.
 I visited Valley Apartments in the hopes of finding a place. Unfortunately, Ms. Evans advised me that they didn't have any apartments available and that for my price range, it would be hard to find something. However, she went the extra mile by taking me into her office and actually looking online and searching for me. She gave me the names of sites to use and even went so far as to check sister properties to see if they had any openings as well as asked a few existing tenants if any of them knew anyone that needed a roommate. All this for a person that she just met off the street that wasn't going to be a tenant. This just doesn't happen every day. I eventually found a place to stay but this simple act of kindness stayed with me. If the world had more people like Ms. Evans, it would be a much place. When my lease is up at my current place, I will definitely be getting back in touch with Ms. Evans in the hopes of moving into her complex.","Hyattsville, MD",0,1,N/A,0
9/14/2017,Madeline S.,-1,5.0,"I have been living this apartment for almost one year, and I just love this place! First of all, the building is located in a very decent neighborhood in Burbank. People living in the community are gracious and a lot of them are working in film industry. As there is a film school, NYFA, and a couple of production companies, Warner Bros. and Disney, nearby, you might easily encounter with directors, actors, screenwriters and other professionals in the film industry. Starbucks, grocery stores, and restaurants are all within walk-in distance. Super convenient!  More importantly, the unit has a great management team. The manager, Josie, is super nice, warm-hearted, supportive, professional and considerate. No matter what problem you have, she is always ready to help. I believe she makes friends with all the tenants. She greets everyone warmly on every day.  Marcelino, who takes care of all the maintenance, is also super professional, nice and helpful.  He fixes things in a speedy and gentle manner. Never delays. All in all, this is a perfect place for students and professionals, singles and families, cats and dogs. Yes, this apt is pet-friendly.  

230号的这间公寓地理位置绝佳，距离纽约电影学院、华纳兄弟等电影公司都非常近。

小区也很安全、安静和方便，楼下有餐厅、咖啡厅以及Trader Joe's等超市。

We had such a hard time because we weren't working in California yet and didn't know anybody or where to start. Luckily we found Josie on a Yelp search and decided to call her. She is the building manager at Valleys apartment. She was very nice and invited us over to her office so she can help us more. Unfortunately she didn't have any available apartment in her building but she did give us some websites and contact information from other management office. She would also email us whenever there's new updates or available apartment viewings. We finally found an apartment that would do short term lease.

Josie Evans (Manager) is just a gem...heart of gold and takes immense pride in making sure the tenants are happy. From the beginning to the end of the process, she helped with every detail and made sure that the apartment was as perfect as it could be for her...fixing any problem IMMEDIATELY if it was necessary. Additionally, she has taken our daughter under her care...introducing her to other tenants with similar interests, the mailman and telling her which local businesses to frequent (even introducing her to those folks in the community too!). Every bit of information that we might need to get her settled was at our fingertips simply for the asking. Valley Apartments is, quite literally, a hidden treasure. Great location (at the end of a cul de sac), awesome tenants (who from what we could see are like a family in their own right), safe neighborhood, quiet, clean and loaded with tons of charm and amenities for the price point.

The building is filled with friendly, pleasant tenants that come from all over the world, many to attend the nearby New York Film Academy.  Although filled with friendly tenants, this building has a quiet atmosphere and is best suited for young professionals.  The neighborhood is possibly one of the best perks.  Situated right on the edge of Toluca Lake, you can easily just cross the street to walk in the quiet neighborhoods of mansions and tree lined streets. A very safe neighborhood at all times day and night.  Just a short walk from Trader Joes and Von's, along with many restaurants including Umami Burger and Lemonade.  The pool and gym are always open and often you'll have it entirely to yourself.  However, above all, the best asset Valley Apartments has to offer is the property manager, Josie.  When first moving to LA, she took us under her wing and helped us adjust to the new city.  As a property manager, she upheld all her duties and more.  She will go above and beyond to make your time at Valley as homey and happy as possible.  Highly recommend Josie and Valley. A+!!!","Providence, RI",0,1,1,0

We moved here about 3 years ago from Maryland, so we came in for a long weekend and looked at about 21 different apartments in 4 days (and drove by 10 more). The moment we walked into this apartment, we knew we had found the place. And not just because it was one of the last places we looked at. ;) It was beautiful, spacious, comfortable, and even on a Sunday morning, without an appointment (though we called first), apartment manager Josie Evans was incredibly helpful, gracious, lovely and kind, and so accommodating. She really was (is!) terrific, showing us the apartment and complex, and introducing us to other tenants, including one who proved very helpful in my husband's new career. Josie takes excellent care of us, including our cats, and she loves our cats as much as she loves her own cat. She's so kind to everyone, people and pets alike, and she goes out of her way to help you. I also adore how pet friendly the entire apartment is.

The apartment is so wonderful. It's big and cozy at the same time, and there are rarely problems with noise or smells, and there are no bugs (thank goodness! I've lived in apartments with roaches and it is the worst). My unit also came with a washer/dryer, and even a fridge, which a lot of apartments don't have. Plus parking in a locked garage. And if you do have a problem, Josie takes care of it immediately. They're really quick to respond if something breaks or stops working, and they either fix it or replace it within a few days. It's right near the highway, but I can't hear the noise inside. You can hear it by the pool, but I personally rarely go swimming, so it makes no difference to me. The neighborhood is also wonderful. I feel incredibly safe and there are great restaurants within walking distance.

We really lucked out finding this place. I'm so happy here, I love my apartment so much. I didn't think we would stay here this long already, and I don't plan to move anytime soon. :)","Burbank, CA",30,4,N/A,0

The moment I entered PRIZMA building I knew it was my dream place...it was like a 5 stars hotel...everything was modern and new...very clean everywhere...the staff were very friendly and helpful...the location is one of the best in LA...I couldn't but move in right away with gratefulness to my leasing agent Andrew, who was a big help for me in so many ways.
From the first week I couldn't expect to feel myself as a family member to everyone in this building, tenants and employees.
I unfortunately stayed less than 2 months there then got locked in Europe because of Covid-19.
But I refused to leave my apartment in PRIZMA even if I don't live in it now, and can't wait to come back after this crise.
Thank you everyone there and hope you are keeping yourself safe.
Big Love I can't wait to see you all :)","Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",0,1,N/A,0

No complaints and glad to call this place home!","Los Angeles, CA",3,1,N/A,0
